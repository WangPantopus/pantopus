## Q1 — Magic Task on My tasks V2 ✅

**Decision**: **Sequenced — plumbing first.** (Matches Recommendation.)

T6.0d ships iOS + Android Magic Task plumbing first: endpoints helper
(11 routes from `backend/routes/magicTask.js`), DTOs (draft / post /
settings / templates), composer screen + view-model, settings store
(`magic_task_instant_post`). The My tasks V2 re-skin PR (P9.5 in the
plan) lands AFTER T6.0d, consuming the new DTOs (specifically the
`task_archetype` + `engagement_mode` / `task_format` fields on the gig
DTO).

**Why this matters**: avoids shipping a re-skinned row with empty
`archetypeOverline` + missing `engagementMode` for every gig posted
before Magic Task ships (and 100% of gigs until the iOS composer
lands). The four shell extensions (`RowLeading.magicArchetypeTile`,
`RowModel.archetypeOverline`, engagement-mode handling,
`FabVariant.magicCreate`) all land in T6.0a *before* the plumbing PR —
the plumbing PR ships a working composer that uses them, and the
re-skin PR is then a pure DTO-to-row mapping change.

---

## Q2 — Bills utility categories ✅

**Decision**: **Client-derive from payee string.** (Diverges from
recommendation.)

The frontend ships a `payeeToCategory(payee: String) -> UtilityCategory?`
helper on iOS + Android + web that matches common payee text to the
8 utility categories (electric / gas / water / internet / hoa /
insurance / trash / phone). Fallback is `generic` (receipt icon over
primary sky tint). **No backend change** to `HomeBill.bill_type` for
this T6 ship.

**Implementation notes**:
- Helper lives in shared mobile feature code:
  `Features/Homes/Bills/PayeeCategory.swift` (iOS),
  `ui/screens/homes/bills/PayeeCategory.kt` (Android),
  `(app)/app/homes/[id]/bills/payee-category.ts` (web).
- Pattern set (case-insensitive substring matches; first-match wins):
  - `electric` — pge, edison, dominion, duke, eversource, conedison
  - `gas` — gas (when not paired with another utility name), socalgas, atmos
  - `water` — water, sewer, municipal water, aqua
  - `internet` — comcast, xfinity, spectrum, att, fios, verizon (internet), tmobile (home), starlink
  - `hoa` — hoa, homeowners association, condo (assn), strata
  - `insurance` — state farm, geico, allstate, progressive, insurance, aaa (auto)
  - `trash` — waste, refuse, recology, trash
  - `phone` — t-mobile, verizon (wireless), att (wireless), sprint, mint mobile, phone
- Fall through to `generic` on no match.
- The match set is a constant table in the helper; future categories
  bolt on without touching the row mapper.

**Why this divergence**: keeps T6 backend untouched on the Bills path,
avoids the schema migration sequencing risk, and ships a useful tile
*today*. **Trade-off**: novel payees (e.g. a small local utility) will
show the generic tile until the helper learns them. This is acceptable
because the user can still see the bill — only the icon tint is
generic. A future tier can promote the field to a backend column once
the patterns settle.

---

## Q3 — Auth phone-OR-email ✅

**Decision**: **Email only for v1.** (Matches Recommendation.)

The rendered Login frame shows email with a `mail` leading icon and
"Email" label (`auth-frames.jsx:113-156`). Backend phone-OTP routes
are MISSING (per §G.5). Shipping phone-OR-email would block T6 on
Twilio wiring + new backend routes (`POST /api/users/login-phone`,
`POST /api/users/verify-phone`) + UX disambiguation between phone-OTP
and password — a separate tier.

Phone-as-identity is filed as a future Tier-N item. The existing
`User.phone_number` column stays as a contact attribute, not an auth
identifier.

---

## Q4 — Auth verify email gating ✅

**Decision**: **Soft-gate with banner.** (Matches Recommendation.)

New users sign in immediately on Create Account success. A persistent
banner ("Verify your email to unlock posting") renders above the main
content on every screen until `user.verified === true`, linking to the
Verify email frame.

The Verify email frame doubles as the landing page from the email-link
deep link (`/verify-email?token=…`) — same screen, different entry
point.

**Wiring**:
- `POST /api/users/verify-email` (users.js:3115) — verify by token /
  code.
- `POST /api/users/resend-verification` (users.js:3049) — banner CTA
  "Resend verification email".
- Banner suppressed once `user.verified` flips true (real-time via
  socket if available, else next refresh).

**Why this matters**: avoids new-user drop-off (every new user has to
leave the app, open mail, click a link, return). Soft-gate keeps
activation high without losing the trust signal — posting / messaging
gate behind the banner if product wants stronger pressure.

---

## Q5 — Hub today-card data source ✅

**Decision**: **Reshape `GET /api/hub` response.** (Matches Recommendation.)

Server-side change to `backend/routes/hub.js` adds three discrete
top-level fields computed from data already in the response:

- `nextPillarEvent: { pillar: 'personal'|'home'|'business', type: string, dueAt: ISO8601, label: string } | null`
  — picks the earliest-by-`dueAt` item from `statusItems[]`.
- `outstandingMail: { personal: number, home: number, total: number }`
  — sums `unreadPersonal` + `homeMail.count` + (any business unread
  count).
- `openGigsNearby: number` — already exists as `gigsNearby` (line 429);
  rename + surface at top level so the field name matches the design.

~30 LOC in `hub.js`. Single round-trip. Both platforms identical
client-side projection.

**Rolled into**: T6.0c backend prep.

**Blocks**: P6 Hub redesign.

---

## Q6 — Me identity gradient header ✅

**Decision**: **Re-skin only — same structure.** (Matches Recommendation.)

Shipped `Features/Me/MeView` already has the 3-color gradient header +
identity switcher + stat tiles + action grid. No VM / routing / endpoint
changes. Visual refresh only:

- 72pt avatar with identity-tinted gradient (sky / green / violet)
- 22pt verified badge overlay (re-use the T5 `VerifiedBadge` at size 22)
- Identity-tinted stat tile cards (replace flat-background tiles)
- 2×3 action grid (replace any existing 3×2 or list-row layout)

Small PR (P7). No feature flag — visual-only changes are reversible
without an enabled-gate.

---

## Q7 — Settings sub-routes ✅

**Decision**: **Wire 6 GroupedList sub-routes in P8; park 2 for P8.5.**
(Matches Recommendation.)

Wired in P8 (each a `GroupedList` variant, ~80 LOC):

| Sub-route | Notes |
|---|---|
| Blocked users | List from `GET /api/blocks` (blocks.js); unblock action. |
| Password | Change password form — wraps `POST /api/users/change-password`. |
| Verification | Status grid (email · phone · home · ID) — reads `user.verified` flags. |
| Help | Static FAQ + contact CTA. No backend. |
| Legal | TOC + links to `legal-frames.jsx` long-form pages. |
| About | Build info, version, OSS attributions. |

Plus the existing P3.1-shipped Notifications + Privacy GroupedList
variants (no change).

Parked for P8.5 (separate PR once dependencies ready):

| Sub-route | Reason for parking |
|---|---|
| Data export | Requires a multi-step Wizard flow + a new backend job runner; out-of-scope for P8. |
| Payments & payouts | Hooks into the Stripe Connect wallet surface (`wallet.js`) — needs the wallet UX to be settled first. |

P8 ships the 6 wired rows + the existing 2; the parked 2 stay on
`.placeholder(label:)` with a tracker-link doc-comment pointing to
P8.5.

---

## Q8 — Mailbox A17 archetype ✅

**Decision**: **New shared shell with 8 slots.** (Matches Recommendation.)

`MailboxA17Shell` lives at:

- iOS: `Features/Shared/MailboxA17/MailboxA17Shell.swift`
- Android: `ui/screens/shared/mailbox_a17/MailboxA17Shell.kt`
- Web: `components/mailbox-a17/MailboxA17Shell.tsx`

Slot contract:

| Slot | Required | Variant-typed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nav` | yes | no | back chevron + uppercase eyebrow + bookmark / kebab |
| `hero` | yes | no | trust chip + category chip + sender + title + reference + optional `Acknowledged` banner |
| `aiElfStrip` | optional | no | sparkles + summary + bulleted key points (gradient sky background) |
| `keyFacts` | optional | no | list of icon+label+value items, optional tags + emphasis |
| `body` | optional | no | body card with paragraphs / formatted text |
| `attachments` | optional | **YES** | sealed `MailboxA17Attachment` enum: `.bookletPages`, `.certifiedChainOfCustody`, `.communityEvent`, `.couponBarcode`, `.packageTimeline` |
| `sender` | yes | no | sender card (avatar + dept + verification kind + proof line) |
| `actions` | yes | no | bottom action row (1–3 buttons) |

The `attachments` slot is the variant point — each design variant
(Booklet / Certified / Community / Package / Coupon) renders its own
attachment payload via the sealed enum. All other slots share the same
component, parameterized by data.

Shell justification: 5 designs share the same composition; one-off
ContentDetail derivatives would duplicate 7 of 8 slots' chrome 5x.
The shell isolates variant logic to one slot.

---

## Q9 — Map+list hybrid sheet ✅

**Decision**: **New shared `MapListHybridShell`.** (Matches Recommendation.)

Lives at:

- iOS: `Features/Shared/MapListHybrid/MapListHybridShell.swift`
- Android: `ui/screens/shared/map_list_hybrid/MapListHybridShell.kt`
- Web: `components/map-list-hybrid/MapListHybridShell.tsx` (CSS-based
  detents via Framer Motion or Vaul, depending on dep policy)

3-detent contract:

| Detent | iOS height | Android dp |
|---|---|---|
| Collapsed | `.height(160)` | 160 |
| Default | `.height(296)` | 296 |
| Expanded | `.height(518)` | 518 |

Iframes the shipped `NearbyMapView` (T2.4) into the new shell — the
old screen's data flow is preserved; only the rendering and gesture
math move into the shell.

Slot contract:

- `topPill` — floating back / title / filter pill (blur background, top edge)
- `categoryChips` — overlay horizontal strip (under topPill)
- `mapControls` — locate-fixed / layers buttons (right edge, floating)
- `sheetHeader` — count + sort selector
- `sheetBody` — vertical list + optional horizontal `GigCard` carousel

Future consumers (Marketplace map mode, Discover businesses map view)
plug into the same shell.

---

## Q10 — Magic Task FAB ✅

**Decision**: **New `FabVariant.magicCreate`.** (Matches Recommendation.)

Adds a fourth case to `FabVariant`:

| Variant | Diameter | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `.canonicalCreate` | 56pt | screen's primary create action (default for back-compat) |
| `.secondaryCreate` | 52pt | non-canonical create (My posts, Connections, Bills *before T6 re-skin*, Pets) |
| `.extendedNav(label:)` | 48pt pill | navigation FAB ("Browse tasks", "Start a train") |
| **`.magicCreate`** | **60pt** | **Magic-Task create — gradient primary600→primary700, plus glyph + 18pt sparkles disc overlay at top-right** |

`magicCreate` consumers in T6:
- My tasks V2 (`.magicCreate`, sparkles+plus, gradient primary600→700)
- Mailbox-A17 root (`.magicCreate` with `scan-line` icon for magic
  ingest — same variant, swappable icon)

Bills' new 60pt home-green-gradient FAB does NOT use `.magicCreate` —
it's a home-tinted variant of `canonicalCreate`. To support that,
`canonicalCreate` gains an optional `tint` parameter (default sky;
override to home-green or business-violet). The geometry stays at 56pt
for tinted canonicals, 60pt only for the magic variant.

> **Open follow-up**: Bills design specifies 60pt for its FAB, not 56pt
> — see `bills-frames.jsx:163-173`. If the 60pt size is intentional
> for the Home pillar's create FABs (and not just My tasks Magic), then
> `canonicalCreate` should pick up a size param too, or we need a
> `homeCreate` variant at 60pt + home-green gradient. Flag for
> designer confirmation. Default: **shrink Bills to 56pt** to match
> the canonical create taxonomy unless the designer pushes back.

## Q11 — Support trains identity tone ⚠️

**Decision**: **Switch to home tone when home-anchored.**
(Diverges from recommendation.)

When the train's `recipient_home_id` is set (the recipient is anchored
to a verified household), the screen renders in **home-green**:
- Tab underline → home-green
- FAB ("Start a train") → home-green pill
- Status-chip "Active" → home-green (replaces sky-blue)
- Inner type-tile gradients unchanged (they encode train kind, not
  identity)

Otherwise (no `recipient_home_id` — purely person-to-person mutual aid),
the screen stays **personal sky-blue** as the design says.

The warm cream intro band (`#fff7ed`) on the "My trains" tab remains
unchanged in both modes — it's a hospitality warmth signal, not an
identity tone.

**Implementation**:
- `SupportTrainsViewModel` exposes `identityTone: IdentityTone`
  derived from the active train context (or list-level: if all
  visible trains are home-anchored, render home tone; otherwise
  personal).
- For the **list screen** (where multiple trains may have different
  anchors), tone is **personal sky-blue** — the screen aggregates
  across many trains. Tone-per-row would be visually noisy.
- For the **train detail screen** (per train), tone follows the
  single train's anchor.

**Why this divergence**: the user's read is that home-anchored trains
are "household coordination" surfaces and inherit the home pillar's
green; pure mutual-aid trains (e.g. for a parent going through cancer
treatment, no household scope) stay personal. The design's "Personal
blue" assertion holds for the unanchored case but is over-broad for
the anchored case.

**Trade-off**: introduces tone variance within the support-trains
surface. Mitigated by the rule that the *list screen* always renders
personal — only detail screens flip.

**Open follow-up**: confirm with designer that this conditional tone
matches their intent, since the original design comment explicitly
says "Personal blue — not Home." If designer pushes back, fall back
to personal always.

## Q12 — Hub redesign cutover ⚠️

**Decision**: **Direct cutover for everyone.** (Diverges from recommendation.)

The Hub redesign ships to 100% of users on T6 release. No
`t6_hub_redesign` feature flag. Hub is the first screen users see —
the user accepts the regression risk for simpler shipping and zero
flag debt.

**Mitigation that must accompany this decision**:

1. **Q5 backend reshape lands FIRST**. The new Hub view expects
   discrete `nextPillarEvent`, `outstandingMail`, `openGigsNearby`
   fields. Cutting over before the backend ships those fields would
   render a broken today-card. Sequence T6.0c (backend prep) →
   `/api/hub` reshape → P6 (Hub view cutover).
2. **Comprehensive snapshot + UI-test sweep before cutover**.
   Paparazzi baselines (Android) + SwiftUI snapshots (iOS) for every
   Hub state: skeleton, first-run, populated (each identity scope),
   error, offline. UI tests for: bell tap → notifications,
   menu tap → settings, today-card tap → respective destination,
   pillar grid → pillar destination, jump-back-in → resolved route.
3. **Rollback plan**: revert PR ready to land in <30 minutes if
   first-paint telemetry shows regression in the first 24 hours
   post-ship.
4. **Beta release** (Android internal track + iOS TestFlight)
   minimum 72 hours before App Store / Play Store production push.

**Why this divergence**: the user's read is that flag debt on Hub
risks becoming permanent (T4.1 had similar flag debt). Direct cutover
with a strong pre-flight gate is simpler. The risk is acknowledged.

---

## Q13 — `engagement_mode` enum collision ✅

**Decision**: **Rename the design's concept to `task_format`.**
(Matches Recommendation.)

The backend's existing `engagement_mode` enum
(`instant_accept | curated_offers | quotes`) keeps its name — it
encodes the **offer-acceptance mode** (Magic Task fast-path vs
curated bidding vs quote-based negotiation).

A NEW `task_format` column is added to the `Gig` table with values
`in_person | drop_off | remote | hybrid` — the **helper-engagement
format** (does the helper come on site, drop something off, work
remotely, or a mix).

The two axes are orthogonal — store both. A gig can be
`engagement_mode='curated_offers'` + `task_format='remote'` (curated
bids for a remote tutoring task), or `engagement_mode='instant_accept'`
+ `task_format='drop_off'` (Magic Task instant-post for a package
pickup).

**Implementation** (folded into T6.0c):
- Migration: `ALTER TABLE Gig ADD COLUMN task_format TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'in_person'`.
- Constraint: `Gig_task_format_chk CHECK (task_format IN ('in_person', 'drop_off', 'remote', 'hybrid'))`.
- Add field to: `POST /api/gigs/magic-post` (magicTask.js:395),
  `POST /api/gigs` (gigs.js:749), `GET /api/gigs/my-gigs`
  (gigs.js:1169 — for the My tasks V2 row to render the badge).
- iOS DTO + Android DTO + Web DTO get the new `task_format` field,
  mapped to an enum.
- Design files and Claude-instruction sessions MUST use `task_format`
  going forward — never `engagement_mode` for the design's concept.

**Why this matters**: storing both axes prevents data corruption
from name collision (`engagement_mode='in_person'` would otherwise
silently violate the backend constraint) and keeps the two
orthogonal product concepts cleanly separated.

## Q14 — Mailbox-A17 root replaces T1.3 ✅

**Decision**: **Replaces.** (Matches Recommendation.)

The shipped T1.3 `MailboxListView` (`Features/Mailbox/MailboxListView.swift`,
`ui/screens/mailbox/MailboxListScreen.kt`) is migrated to the new
A17 root:

- **Top-level**: drawer pills (`Me / Home / Biz / Earn`) driven by
  the user's identity list — replaces the single-list-of-mail view.
- **Inner tabs**: `Incoming / Counter / Vault` — replaces the
  `All / Unread / Starred` tabs.
- **Per-row state**: `unread` becomes a row-state filter applied
  inside Incoming (e.g. an "Unread only" toggle), not a top-level
  tab.
- **FAB**: magic-ingest scan-line FAB (variant `.magicCreate` with
  `scan-line` icon, primary600 disc).
- **Search**: existing search icon stays in the top bar; opens a
  search overlay over the current drawer's inbox.

**Migration plan**:
- Old tab ids `tab.all`, `tab.unread`, `tab.starred` deprecated.
- New tab ids `tab.incoming`, `tab.counter`, `tab.vault`.
- Drawer pill ids `drawer.me`, `drawer.home`, `drawer.biz`,
  `drawer.earn`.
- Deep links / push notifications that pointed at
  `/app/mailbox?tab=unread` get rewritten to
  `/app/mailbox?drawer=me&tab=incoming&filter=unread`.
- Parity audit row for T1.3 marked **superseded by P19 (T6)**.

**Why this matters**: the drawer pill is a more meaningful identity
scope than the All/Unread/Starred filter — mail belongs to a
*pillar* (your personal mail vs your home's mail vs your business's
mail), and the unread/starred state is per-row, not a separate axis.

---

## Q15 — MyHomes refresh replaces T1.4 row ✅

**Decision**: **Replaces.** (Matches Recommendation.)

The shipped T1.4 row (40pt icon + title + subtitle + chevron) is
replaced by the new richer row:

- 56pt address tile (initials over home-green gradient; map-pin glyph
  reserved for empty/loading)
- Address line + verification check
- Locality + role chip (`Owner / Resident / Manager / Tenant / Guest`)
  + member count
- Inline stats strip (packages · bills · tasks counts)
- "Current" affordance pinned on the home the user is actively
  switched into

Same data shape — only the rendering changes. Single row-shape per
screen is the convention. Drop the old layout.

**Backend additions needed?** The stats strip needs aggregate counts
(packages / bills / tasks). The shipped `GET /api/homes/my-homes`
returns the home rows but not aggregate counts per home. **Folded
into T6.0c backend prep**: extend the response to include per-home
`{packages_count, bills_count, tasks_count}` aggregates (or surface
these from the existing data already loaded for the dashboard, if
cheap).

**Open follow-up**: confirm with backend that the aggregate counts
can be computed cheaply per home (probably yes via 3 small COUNT()
queries with a `WHERE home_id IN (...)` filter against
`HomePackage`, `HomeBill`, `HomeTask`). If expensive, fall back to a
lazy-load pattern (counts populate after first paint).

---

## Q16 — Beacon backend mapping ✅

**Decision**: **`/api/personas/:handle`.** (Matches Recommendation.)

The Public Beacon profile is the creator-persona public surface,
distinct from the generic user public profile at `/api/users/id/:id`.

**Routes (all real, used by existing Audience + Handshake surfaces)**:
- `GET /api/personas/:handle` — persona profile (name, bio, avatar,
  cover, tier list)
- `GET /api/personas/:handle/posts` — broadcasts feed
- `GET /api/personas/:handle/tiers` — paid-tier list
- `POST /api/personas/:handle/follow` — handshake initiation

The 4 frames map to states of the same surface:
- **Persona visitor** — `viewer != owner`, `is_follower=false` →
  Follow CTA
- **Persona owner** — `viewer == owner` → Edit CTA + draft-broadcasts
- **Local visitor** — `viewer != owner`, viewer is a local neighbor
  → may unlock additional tabs / content
- **Empty** — persona has no broadcasts yet

The "Local visitor" frame's additional unlock state (if it requires
new backend fields beyond what `/api/personas/:handle` returns today)
is filed as a backend follow-up to confirm before P16.5.

---

## Q17 — Web parity scope ⚠️

**Decision**: **Required for ALL 46 new screens.** (Diverges from
recommendation.)

Every T6-new mobile screen gets a web companion at parity. The 10
home-pillar deep screens that have no web route today
(Maintenance, Calendar, Documents, Polls, Members, Access codes,
Emergency, Packages, Vault, Owners) gain new web routes alongside
their mobile counterparts.

**Scope impact**:
- 10 additional new web pages, each a fresh implementation under
  `frontend/apps/web/src/app/(app)/app/homes/[id]/<feature>/page.tsx`
  (or equivalent) using the shared `<ListOfRowsShell />` web mirror
  from T5.0.
- Per-PR scope grows: each home-pillar feature PR (P10–P15, P15.5)
  now ships iOS + Android + web in the same commit.
- The T6 ship date moves out — estimate 30-50% additional PR labor
  for the home-pillar tier.

**Mitigation**:
- The shared `<ListOfRowsShell />` web mirror (shipped in T5.0) takes
  most of the chrome boilerplate off. Each new web page is
  effectively a row-mapper + endpoint hook + a thin page wrapper.
- Web routes for home-pillar screens are mostly admin/desktop
  power-user surfaces — full keyboard support, no need to optimize
  for narrow phone viewport.
- Auth, Hub, Me, Settings, Chat, Marketplace, Pulse, Gigs, Mailbox
  refresh PRs already had implicit web parity (existing routes); the
  new burden is just the 10 home-pillar deep screens.

**Per-PR acceptance gate** (`docs/mobile-screen-definition-of-done.md`
already requires this for shipped-on-web screens; now extended to
T6-new home-pillar):
- iOS + Android + web land in the same commit.
- Web route added to `frontend/apps/web/src/app/(app)/app/...`.
- Web test (`*.test.tsx`) at minimum covers the row-mapping projection.
- Parity audit row records the new web route.

**Why this divergence**: the user wants triple-platform parity to be
the *invariant* for T6, same as it was for T5. Mobile-first cadence
was the wrong framing — the platforms should ship together so users
who switch between web and mobile see the same surfaces.

**Open follow-up**: confirm with the web team that the 10 new
home-pillar pages can be staffed in parallel with the mobile PRs, or
plan to sequence them serially (mobile leads by 1-2 PRs, web
catches up the same week).

**Aligned**: 13 / 17. **Diverged**: 4 — Q2 (Bills), Q11 (trains tone),
Q12 (Hub flag), Q17 (web parity).

## Cross-cutting follow-ups surfaced by the decisions

1. **Designer confirmation needed** (none of these block T6.0a, but
   should land before the consuming PR):
   - Q10: Is Bills' 60pt FAB intentional (vs 56pt canonical)?
   - Q11: Conditional home-tinted support-trains tone matches intent?
   - Q15: MyHomes per-home aggregate counts in the stats strip.
   - Q16: Beacon "Local visitor" frame's unlock state requires new
     backend fields?

2. **Backend prep additions to T6.0c** (folded into the same PR):
   - Add `phone` to `HomeBill.bill_type` enum — **CANCELLED** per Q2
     (client-derive instead).
   - Add `ceremonial` to `mail_object_type` or `is_ceremonial` flag
     (Q14 doesn't change this; still needed for ceremonial mail).
   - Add `task_format` column to Gig + constraint + DTO additions
     to `/magic-post`, `/api/gigs`, `/my-gigs` (Q13).
   - Reshape `/api/hub` to add discrete `nextPillarEvent` /
     `outstandingMail` / `openGigsNearby` (Q5).
   - Add per-home `{packages_count, bills_count, tasks_count}` to
     `/api/homes/my-homes` (Q15).
   - PATCH/DELETE for Documents + Emergencies at `home.js`.
   - Maintenance CRUD (4 new routes).

3. **Scope expansion**:
   - Q17: 10 additional new web pages for home-pillar deep screens.
     Re-baseline T6 ship date with the web team.

4. **Flag debt avoided**: no feature flags introduced (Q6 / Q12 / Q15
   all rejected flag-gating). Hub cutover relies on pre-flight snapshot
   + UI tests + beta soak + revert-ready rollback instead.
