# Chat / Messaging — Production Readiness Backlog

> **Historical context:** Written while the mobile client was React Native at `frontend/apps/mobile/`. That app has been replaced by native iOS ([`frontend/apps/ios`](../frontend/apps/ios)) and Android ([`frontend/apps/android`](../frontend/apps/android)). Mobile references (e.g. `frontend/apps/mobile/src/hooks/useChatMessages.ts`) should be mapped to their Swift/Kotlin equivalents. See the root README "Migration notes (from React Native)" section.

This is the full production-readiness backlog for the current chat/message stack, based on backend/routes/chats.js, backend/socket/chatSocketio.js, backend/database/schema.sql, backend/routes/upload.js, frontend/apps/web/src/hooks/useChatMessages.ts, and frontend/apps/mobile/src/hooks/useChatMessages.ts.

1. Access Control And Data Exposure

Revoke direct anon and authenticated execution on chat-related SECURITY DEFINER RPCs and raw chat tables unless they are explicitly safe for client-side use.
Move sensitive chat RPCs to a non-exposed schema, or bind them to auth.uid() internally so callers cannot pass arbitrary user IDs.
Fix all chat RLS policies so room/message/participant access always requires is_active = true.
Ensure removed participants immediately lose message, room, and participant visibility everywhere, including canonical person-conversation queries.
Audit every business-identity path so authorization is explicit and revocable; do not silently grant durable room access unless required.
Add server-side blocklist enforcement so blocked users cannot create chats, fetch history, send messages, react, or upload chat files.
Add abuse controls for spam, harassment, flooding, and repeated unsolicited direct-chat creation.
Add admin/moderation access rules separately from normal user access; do not piggyback on service-role reads.
2. Media And Attachment Security

Replace public file_url chat attachments with authenticated downloads or short-lived signed URLs.
Ensure S3/CloudFront is not publicly readable for chat media.
Add malware scanning for uploaded chat files before they become accessible.
Add MIME sniffing and extension validation; do not trust only file.mimetype.
Strip EXIF/location metadata from images unless there is an intentional product reason to preserve it.
Add per-room attachment authorization checks on download, not just upload.
Add content-size, file-count, and storage-quota enforcement specifically for chat.
Add retention and deletion handling for attachments tied to deleted/redacted messages.
3. Realtime Contract And Delivery Semantics

Pick one source of truth for message delivery semantics and align REST, Socket.IO, and DB contracts to it.
Remove or replace dead/drifted socket paths that rely on missing or mismatched RPCs.
Fix the current socket payload mismatch between get_user_chat_rooms output and what the socket server expects.
Make reconnect deterministic: on reconnect, fetch missed messages since the last acknowledged cursor before resuming live events.
Add idempotent send semantics with a client-generated message UUID or idempotency key.
Add explicit delivery states: queued, sent, persisted, delivered, failed.
Add server acknowledgements that include canonical message ID, server timestamp, room ID, and any transformed fields.
Deduplicate server events by canonical message ID on both server and client.
Make read receipts precise and consistent; if message-level receipts are supported, persist a true cursor rather than just zeroing unread count.
Keep typing events ephemeral and rate-limited, and verify room membership before every typing broadcast.
4. Data Model Hardening

Add a canonical direct-conversation uniqueness model so two concurrent creates cannot produce duplicates.
Persist both actor_user_id and sender_identity_user_id for business messaging; today the human actor is lost when sending as a business.
Validate reply_to_id belongs to the same room and is visible to the sender.
Validate topic_id belongs to the same allowed conversation pair and room context.
Store a monotonic room-local ordering key or sequence for stable pagination and replay.
Move room summary fields into durable server-maintained state: last message ID, last message time, preview, participant counts, unread counts if needed.
Make message insert, room summary update, unread update, and topic activity update transactional.
Define and implement a real deleted-message retention job instead of doing redaction work on read paths.
Decide whether person-grouped conversations are the canonical model or just a derived inbox view; remove the current hybrid ambiguity.
5. Inbox And Message Query Performance

Replace the current “fetch N recent rows across all rooms and hope coverage is enough” strategy for inbox previews with per-room summary state or a proper ranked query.
Remove the per-room exact-count N+1 query pattern from unified conversations.
Use cursor pagination with (created_at, id) or a sequence key, not timestamp alone.
Add/verify indexes for the actual hot paths: (room_id, deleted, created_at desc, id), (user_id, is_active, joined_at), reaction lookups, and room-summary lookups.
Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE for room list, unified conversations, room message fetch, conversation fetch, reaction fetch, and mark-read.
Add pagination response cursors from the server rather than inferring hasMore from length === limit.
Keep deleted-message redaction off the critical read path.
Cache or precompute inbox totals and badge counts instead of recomputing full exact counts on every open.
6. REST API Hardening

Add chat-specific write rate limits for send, react, edit, delete, participant changes, and direct-chat creation.
Add payload validation for all cross-object references, not just UUID shape.
Standardize error codes for auth failure, rate limit, blocked user, invalid attachment, stale cursor, duplicate send, and business-identity auth.
Make all room-fetch endpoints consistently enforce active membership and business-identity authorization.
Remove API surface that exists in the client package but has no backend implementation, or implement it fully.
Ensure edit/delete permissions are correct for represented business messages and audit requirements.
Make mark-read APIs consistent across REST and sockets; right now the signatures and semantics drift.
7. Client Reliability

On web and mobile, actually use the room:join callback payload and/or force a post-reconnect refresh.
Stop trusting local unread increments for inbox state; reconcile from authoritative server badge/inbox payloads.
Add resend/retry handling for transient failures without creating duplicate messages.
Persist unsent drafts and pending attachments across refresh/app background if chat is a core feature.
Handle offline mode explicitly: queue or block sends cleanly, surface failure state, and replay safely.
Make optimistic sends use the same idempotency key the server understands.
Ensure business-identity message ownership is rendered consistently in thread view, inbox view, reactions, edits, and deletes.
Add upload progress, cancel, and failure UI for attachments.
Refresh thread state after foreground resume on mobile, not only when the socket happens to reconnect cleanly.
8. Moderation, Privacy, And Compliance

Add message reporting, moderation queueing, and reviewer tooling for abusive content.
Define retention, redaction, legal hold, and export policies for chat data.
Define who can view deleted messages and for how long.
Add audit logging for participant adds/removes, business-identity sends, moderation actions, and access-sensitive operations.
Add privacy review for attachment URLs, logs, notification payloads, and admin tooling.
Ensure chat notifications do not leak sensitive message content on lock screens or shared business devices without policy.
9. Observability And Operations

Add request IDs and socket session IDs to logs so a send can be traced across API, DB write, socket broadcast, and client receipt.
Instrument p50/p95/p99 for send latency, thread load, inbox load, reconnect recovery, upload latency, and badge refresh latency.
Track duplicate-send rate, reconnect-miss rate, unread drift rate, socket auth failure rate, and attachment upload failure rate.
Add alerts for elevated send failures, socket connect failures, DB query regressions, and unexpected 403/500 spikes on chat endpoints.
Create runbooks for message-delivery incidents, media-access incidents, unread-count drift, and moderation escalation.
Load test reconnect storms, noisy-room inboxes, concurrent direct-chat creation, attachment bursts, and mark-read churn.
10. Test Program

Add real integration tests against actual Postgres/Supabase with RLS enabled; mocked unit tests are not enough.
Add socket end-to-end tests for connect, join, send, reconnect, duplicate event handling, read receipts, and reactions.
Add security tests for removed participants, blocked users, unauthorized business impersonation, and direct DB/RPC bypass attempts.
Add concurrency tests for duplicate direct-chat creation and simultaneous sends from multiple devices.
Add pagination tests that cover same-timestamp messages, backfill after reconnect, and no-gap/no-dup guarantees.
Add attachment tests for private download authorization, signed URL expiry, malware failure, and MIME mismatch.
Add performance regression tests for inbox list and message fetch queries at realistic production cardinalities.
Launch Bar

No unauthorized history access in integration/security tests.
No duplicate message creation under retries/reconnect.
No lost messages after reconnect in end-to-end tests.
Inbox and thread queries must be bounded, indexed, and benchmarked at realistic scale.
Attachment access must be private and auditable.
REST, socket, and database contracts must match exactly with no legacy drift paths left.
