```

The `Pantopus.xcodeproj` is NOT committed. It's generated from `project.yml` by XcodeGen. Run `make bootstrap` before opening in Xcode.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Xcode is macOS-only)
- **Xcode 15.4+** (Swift 5.10, iOS 17 SDK)
- Homebrew

```bash
brew install xcodegen swiftlint swiftformat fastlane
```

## First-time setup

```bash
cd frontend/apps/ios
cp .env.example .env
make bootstrap
make open            # opens Pantopus.xcodeproj in Xcode
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Select the `Pantopus` target → **Signing & Capabilities**.
2. Set **Team** to your Apple developer team. Bundle ID stays `app.pantopus.ios`.
3. Pick an iPhone simulator (e.g. iPhone 15).
4. ⌘R to run.

## Common tasks

| Task                            | Command                                |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Regenerate Xcode project        | `make bootstrap`                       |
| Open in Xcode                   | `make open`                            |
| Build for simulator             | `make build`                           |
| Run unit + UI tests             | `make test`                            |
| Lint                            | `make lint`                            |
| Format in place                 | `make format`                          |
| Clean build + generated project | `make clean`                           |
| TestFlight upload               | `make beta` (needs Apple cert setup)   |
| App Store submission            | `make release`                         |

## Architecture

The app follows an MVVM structure with strict concurrency and the new `@Observable` macro (no more `ObservableObject` + `@Published`).

- **`AppEnvironment`** — resolves the API/socket base URLs and Stripe key. Driven by the scheme env var `PANTOPUS_API_ENV` (one of `local`, `staging`, `production`).
- **`APIClient`** — URLSession-based, async/await. Auto-attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to authenticated endpoints, decodes JSON with snake_case → camelCase conversion, maps `401` → `AuthManager.handleUnauthorized()`.
- **`AuthManager`** — `@Observable` `@MainActor`. Owns `State { unknown | signedOut | signedIn(user) }`, persists tokens to the Keychain via `KeychainStore`, restores the session on launch.
- **`SocketClient`** — Socket.IO wrapper. Exposes events as `AsyncStream<T: Decodable>` for clean `for await` usage in view models.
- **`Features/*`** — feature-scoped folders. Each screen has a `View` + a view model (`@Observable final class`). Keep side effects in view models; keep views pure.

## Adding a new feature

1. Create `Pantopus/Features/YourFeature/` with `YourFeatureView.swift` and `YourFeatureViewModel.swift`.
2. Add the relevant DTO to `Pantopus/Core/Networking/Models/Models.swift`.
3. Hit the API through the shared `APIClient.shared.request(…)` — don't spin up new URLSessions.
4. If you introduce a new SPM package, add it to `project.yml`'s `packages:` section and the target's `dependencies:`, then run `make bootstrap`.

## Push notifications

`AppDelegate.didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` forwards the APNs token to `POST /api/notifications/register` with `platform: "ios"`. The backend currently routes through `expo-server-sdk` for historical reasons — see [`docs/push-native-migration.md`](../../../docs/push-native-migration.md) for the migration plan to direct APNs.

## Device-on-LAN testing

Running the app on a physical device but the backend on your Mac? The simulator's `localhost` won't work. Options:

1. Add your Mac's LAN IP to `AppEnvironment.swift` as a new target or edit the `.local` base URL.
2. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) to expose the backend.

## Release checklist

See `fastlane/Fastfile`. At minimum, before `make beta`:

- [ ] `match` is set up for code signing (`fastlane match init`).
- [ ] `.env` has the production Stripe key.
- [ ] `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` and `MARKETING_VERSION` in `project.yml` are bumped.
- [ ] `make test` passes locally.
