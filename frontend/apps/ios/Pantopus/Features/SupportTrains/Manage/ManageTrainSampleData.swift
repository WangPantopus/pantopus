//  A13.13 — Manage train. Deterministic fixtures the view-model loads
//  on `load()` and previews/snapshot tests render directly. The
//  backend has been removed from the repo, so this surface is fed
//  entirely from the two design-source frames:
//
//    • ACTIVE   — day 12/21 of a Murphy-family meal train (18/21 slots
//                 filled, 1 dropout, draft update typed and ready to
//                 send to the 12 active helpers).
//    • CLOSING  — same train mid-`Close train` confirmation (3-cell
//                 summary stats + italic recipient testimonial + empty
//                 thank-you textarea).
