//  A10.7 — Render-only models for the single-business owner dashboard.
//  The owner view is the owner-facing twin of A10.6: it reuses the exact
//  public render (`BusinessProfileContent`, from B3.1) for the
//  "preview as neighbor" frame, and overlays owner-only chrome — live
//  status, insight tiles, a profile-strength card, edit-affordance rows,
//  and a per-review reply composer — for the owner / edit frame.
//
//  The shared business truth lives in `publicProfile`; the owner frame
//  reads its header / status / categories / about / hours / service area /
//  services / gallery / rating summary from there, so the two frames can
//  never describe different businesses (the design's shared `MARLOW`
//  const).
//
//  Design reference: `docs/designs/A10/business-owner-frames.jsx`
//  (FrameOwnerEdit + FramePreviewPublic) and
//  `docs/new-design-parity-batch2.md` § A10.7. Business violet throughout.
