//  A10.7 — the hand-authored owner-view frame used by previews, the
//  snapshot reference, and Android parity. Marlow & Co. Cleaning, the
//  same business as the A10.6 sample (`BusinessProfileSampleData.populated`)
//  so the owner frame and its "preview as neighbor" describe one business
//  (the design's shared `MARLOW` const).

//  Insights / profile strength / reviews are sample-driven (no analytics or
