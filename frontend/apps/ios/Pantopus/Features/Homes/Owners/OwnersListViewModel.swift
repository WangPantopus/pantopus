//  P15 / T6.3g — Backs `OwnersListView`. Reads
//  `GET /api/homes/:id/owners` (`backend/routes/homeOwnership.js:1381`)
//  and projects each `OwnerDTO` onto a `RowModel` using the avatar-first
//  shape: 40pt avatar with verified-check overlay + name + proof chip +
//  role subtitle + body proof-status line + kebab. FAB opens the
//  existing Invite Owner form. Kebab opens an action sheet with
//  Remove (DELETE /:ownerId).
