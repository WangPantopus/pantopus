//
//  MailboxMapViewModel.swift
//  Pantopus
//
//  A11.4 Mailbox map view-model. Owns the sheet detent, the active
//  category-chip filter, and the pin↔detail selection link.
//
//  DOMAIN CAVEAT: the *screen* is a venue directory (post offices / drop
//  boxes / lockers / carriers, with operating hours + services), but the
//  only backend "map" route is `GET /api/mailbox/v2/p3/map/pins`, which
//  returns `HomeMapPin` rows — household / neighborhood annotations
//  (permits, deliveries, notices, civic alerts). There is no
//  venue-directory backend, so `load()` fetches pins and projects them
//  into `MailboxSpot` lossily (no hours / services; deterministic
//  synthetic canvas positions). Mirrors Android
//  `ui/screens/mailbox/mailbox_map/MailboxMapViewModel.kt`.
//
//  No pins → `.populated([])` (the sheet renders its inline empty note);
//  a transport failure → `.error(message:)` with Retry. The sample
//  directory is a preview / snapshot seam only — it is never surfaced as
//  if it were live data.
