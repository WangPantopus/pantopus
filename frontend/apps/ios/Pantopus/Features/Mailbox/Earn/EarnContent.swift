//  A10.11 — pure value types backing the Earn dashboard. The earnings-IN
//  sibling of the A10.10 Wallet: same dark-hero vocabulary, but framed
//  around MAKING money (weekly-goal momentum, ways to earn, earnings
//  list, payout settings, tax docs). Mirrors the shape of
//  `docs/designs/A10/earn-frames.jsx` so the populated / empty variants
//  snapshot reproducibly. UI types stay out of the model — the view maps
//  `EarnCategory` → `Theme.Color` + `PantopusIcon` and `EarnAccent` →
