//
//  H14 Accessibility & Large-Text pass · Stream I18. The accessibility contract
//  for the Calendarly surface, encoded as data so it is testable and reviewable
//  (see SchedulingA11yTests). Each finding records a surface, the requirement it
//  is checked against, whether it passes today, and — when flagged — the
//  follow-up issue to file against the OWNING stream's files (H14 never edits
//  another stream's code; it files follow-ups, preserving disjointness).
//
//  Findings reflect a read of the merged surface on `feature/calendarly`
//  (Foundation SlotPicker/SchedulingSlotRow, I6 confirmed screen, and this
//  stream's H15). The human-readable report lives in SchedulingA11yAudit.md.
