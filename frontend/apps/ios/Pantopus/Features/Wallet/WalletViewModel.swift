//  READ-PATH wiring (P1-F): the production initializer hydrates the balance
//  hero + Recent-activity feed from live data —
//    GET /api/wallet               (available balance)
//    GET /api/wallet/transactions  (activity feed)
//    GET /api/wallet/pending-release (escrow breakdown → pending total)
//  The withdraw / payout surface (payout method card, tax docs, Withdraw CTA)
//  is intentionally left on its P3.2 visual placeholder — `POST
//  /api/wallet/withdraw` and the Stripe Connect payout method land in Phase 3.
//
//  Previews / snapshots / unit tests still seed deterministic
//  `WalletContent` via `init(content:)` / `init(state:)`, which bypass the
//  network; `content.isOnHold` selects populated vs. hold. State machine
//  matches the doc's four-state rule: loading / populated / hold / error.
