/**
 * A10.7 — the hand-authored owner-view frame used by previews, the Paparazzi
 * snapshot, and iOS parity. Marlow & Co. Cleaning, the same business as the
 * A10.6 sample ([BusinessProfileSampleData.populated]) so the owner frame and
 * its "preview as neighbor" describe one business.
 *
 * Insights / profile strength / reviews are sample-driven (no analytics or
 * review-reply backend in B3.2). Mirrors iOS `BusinessOwnerSampleData.swift`.
