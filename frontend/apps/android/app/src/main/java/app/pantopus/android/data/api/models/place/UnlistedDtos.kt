 * and `backend/routes/unlisted.js:31 / :64` (claimed home, T1+ — NOT
 * gated on verification). Service `backend/services/unlistedService.js`.
 *
 * TWO NULLS CARRY MEANING HERE, and the UI must render them
 * differently from empty:
 *
 *  * [UnlistedProfile.stateProgram] `null` means WE DID NOT CHECK this
 *    state — never "this state has no program". Those are different
 *    claims and only the second one, which arrives as
 *    `exists: false` with its own source, is ours to make. Collapsing
 *    them tells someone in danger that no help exists when we simply
 *    did not look.
 *  * [UnlistedProfile.removals] `null` means the progress READ FAILED.
 *    An empty list means "nothing recorded yet" — a confident claim we
 *    cannot make when the read failed.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE ASSERTS THAT A PERSON IS LISTED ANYWHERE. We do not
 * query these sites: searching them would hand them the address. That
 * is why there is no `found` field, and why [UnlistedProfile.methodNote]
 * must be rendered verbatim near the broker list — without it the page
 * implies a scan it never performed.
