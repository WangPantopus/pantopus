/**
 * A refusal from address verification, mapped to something a person can act on.
 *
 * UX-06 — neither native client had any address layer. The wizard let the user
 * complete every step, then rendered the 422 from `POST /api/homes` through the
 * generic networking path, so they saw "Request failed" with no indication of
 * what was wrong with their address or what to change. The `code` the server
 * sends was referenced nowhere in the app (audit 2026-08-22).
 *
 * Copy is kept deliberately close to the web and iOS wizards so the same
 * refusal reads the same on every platform.
