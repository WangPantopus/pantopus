package app.pantopus.android.data.scheduling

/**
 * The one owner-context pattern every scheduling call internalizes.
 *
 * The backend exposes the same scheduling router under two mounts and resolves
 * "whose schedule" three ways:
 *  - **Personal** → `/api/scheduling/…`, no owner fields (defaults to the
 *    signed-in user).
 *  - **Business** → `/api/scheduling/…` with `owner_type=business` +
 *    `owner_id=<businessUserId>` (query on reads, body on writes — we send it
 *    as a query universally, which the `owner_type+owner_id in query/body`
 *    middleware reads on every method).
 *  - **Home** → the `/api/homes/{homeId}/scheduling/…` alias (owner implied by
 *    the path; no owner fields).
 *
 * [basePath] is the encoded segment fed to `SchedulingApi`'s `{base}` path
 * param; [ownerType]/[ownerId] are the nullable query/body owner fields.
 *
 * Note: a few endpoints are *always personal* regardless of owner
 * (`availability*`, `notification-preferences`, `connected-calendars`,
 * `my-bookings`, `my-packages`) and use the fixed `api/scheduling/...` path —
 * they ignore [SchedulingOwner]. Home-only coordination reads (`find-a-time`,
 * `whos-free`) and business-only `team-availability` take the owner id directly
 * on the repository method per the backend's documented query form.
