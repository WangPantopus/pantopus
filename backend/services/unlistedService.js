/**
 * Unlisted (Wave 4) — "type your address to get it off the internet."
 *
 * The acquisition slice, and the one aimed at the hardest audience:
 * people who will not hand an address to anything. The pitch inverts
 * the usual ask — you give us the address in order to make it LESS
 * visible, not more.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, and the honesty that holds it together:
 *
 *   1. THE STATE'S ESCAPE HATCH, first. Most states run an Address
 *      Confidentiality Program: a legal substitute address for survivors
 *      of domestic violence, stalking, assault or trafficking, which
 *      fixes the problem at the SOURCE instead of chasing it across
 *      thirty sites forever. Someone on this page is disproportionately
 *      likely to be there because of a specific person, so this leads.
 *
 *   2. THE REMOVAL PATHS. Which sites republish county property records,
 *      what each publishes, and the exact verified opt-out for each.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — and this is a deliberate product decision, not a
 * gap: it does not query people-search sites to check whether a given
 * address is listed. Doing so would DISCLOSE that address to the very
 * companies the person is trying to remove it from — a scan meant to
 * reduce exposure would create it. (It is also legally grey, brittle,
 * slow enough to kill the conversion it exists to drive, and needs the
 * standing scraper staffing that is the stated reason the erase tier
 * waits.)
 *
 * The consequence runs through every field name here: nothing in this
 * service asserts that a person IS listed anywhere. There is no `found`
 * flag and there must never be one. We describe what a site publishes
 * and how to leave it — both true without querying anyone.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the T0 path persists NOTHING. It takes an address, resolves a
 * state, and returns a profile that is identical for everyone in that
 * state. The address is never stored, never logged with the result, and
 * never sent anywhere. Progress tracking (which brokers you have
 * written to) exists only once you have claimed the home, is scoped to
 * you rather than the household, and lives behind RLS — a row saying
 * "this person is erasing their address" is exactly what must not leak.
