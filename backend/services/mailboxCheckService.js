/**
 * Mailbox Reality Check (Wave 1, #3)
 *
 * "Can USPS, lenders, and delivery apps actually find your address?"
 * — answered from data the claim pipeline ALREADY collected (the
 * Smarty/Google validation stored on HomeAddress: DPV match, RDI type,
 * vacancy, missing-unit flags), plus the postcard as the physical leg.
 * Zero new vendor calls: this productizes the verification step into a
 * diagnostic with results and fix-it guidance.
 *
 * Honesty rules:
 *   * every finding names its source ("USPS's deliverability database")
 *     and what Pantopus can and cannot do — we point at the fix, we
 *     cannot edit USPS records;
 *   * no data on file is said plainly ("no postal check is on file"),
 *     never dressed up as a pass;
 *   * the postcard is presented as what it is: the end-to-end physical
 *     proof that mail reaches the box.
