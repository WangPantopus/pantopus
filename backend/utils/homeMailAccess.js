/**
 * Household mail access scoping.
 *
 * This is the sole authorization gate for the physical-mail routes — the one
 * surface where a verified address produces continuous, high-sensitivity
 * third-party data (who writes to this household: scanned envelopes, sender
 * identities, package notifications).
 *
 * It used to be duplicated verbatim in five route files. Four filtered
 * `is_active = true`; the copy in routes/mailbox.js did not, and additionally
 * admitted any `Home.owner_id` match, so a roommate who had properly moved out
 * kept reading the household's mail indefinitely on that surface while
 * correctly losing it on the other four (audit 2026-08-22, CRIT-03).
 *
 * One definition, one behaviour. Do not inline a copy of this.

/**
 * Occupancy verification states that may read the household's physical mail.
 *
 * `is_active` alone is not enough: applyOccupancyTemplate writes
 * `is_active: true` for `pending_approval` and `pending_postcard` rows, and
 * POST /api/homes/:id/claim creates one of those for any authenticated caller
 * on any home id (which POST /api/homes/check-address hands out). Filtering
 * only on is_active therefore let an unapproved stranger read a household's
 * scanned envelopes and sender identities the moment they filed a claim —
 * while the claim route's own contract says "mailbox and private home surfaces
 * remain locked until verified".
 *
 * `provisional_bootstrap` is included deliberately: it is what the person who
 * created the home is given (routes/home.js), and locking them out of their own
 * mailbox would break the ordinary path. The excluded states are the ones a
 * stranger can reach unilaterally — pending_postcard, pending_doc,
 * pending_approval, unverified — plus any that mean the residency has ended.
 * Enum values: migration 065.
