-- Migration 164: Residency letters — expiry, and row level security
--
-- A residency letter is a server-attested, publicly-verifiable credential that
-- is consumed OUTSIDE our trust boundary, by landlords, schools and the DMV. It
-- carries the resident's legal name and full street address.
--
-- As shipped it had no expiry, could be revoked only by its issuer, kept
-- reporting valid:true after revocation, and the table had no RLS while
-- migration 157 granted the anon and authenticated roles blanket access
-- (audit 2026-08-22, SEC-10/LIF-06).
