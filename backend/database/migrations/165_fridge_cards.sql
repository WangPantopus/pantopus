-- Wave 1 (#2) — The Fridge Card: a 911-ready household card.
--
-- Everything a panicking babysitter or a first responder at the door
-- needs said out loud — starting with the EXACT verified address, the
-- first thing every dispatcher asks for — plus whatever the household
-- chose to put on it: members and allergies, meds, pets, gas/water
-- shutoffs, emergency contacts.
--
-- Design stance (mirrors letters and claims):
--   * content is FROZEN at issue — the household saw exactly what the
--     card shares before sharing it; edits mean issuing a fresh card;
--   * the address block is SERVER-derived from the verified home row,
--     never client input;
--   * the card lives behind an unguessable ~78-bit code; a revoked
--     card's page shows "no longer active" and NO content — this is
--     health-adjacent data, so revocation must actually pull it;
--   * cards are HOUSEHOLD documents (unlike personal letters/claims):
--     any member of the home can see them; issuing requires a verified
--     resident with home-manage permission.
--
-- Honest scope: this is what the caller reads aloud and what the
-- babysitter scans — it is NOT delivered to dispatch. Copy must never
-- imply PSAP integration (the Smart911 lesson).
