-- Migration 163: Home.owner_id — allow NULL, and stop cascading Home deletion
--
-- Two critical findings from the 2026-08-22 audit share one root cause:
-- `Home.owner_id` is NOT NULL with ON DELETE CASCADE.
--
-- LIF-01. Because the column cannot be cleared, no leave path clears it.
--   `checkHomePermission` treats `Home.owner_id === userId` as legacy ownership
--   (utils/homePermissions.js), so a user who moves out — or removes
--   themselves via DELETE /:id/members/:self, where the owner guard is
--   explicitly disabled for self — keeps full administrative control of the
--   home forever, including the ability to delete it.
--
-- LIF-02. Because the FK cascades, deleting the owner's User row deletes the
--   Home, and with it every other resident's occupancy, verification history,
--   audit log and residency letters. Account deletion pre-checks exist for
--   gigs and escrow but not for homes, so this is reachable by any owner
--   deleting their own account.
--
-- Making the column nullable lets a home outlive its original owner and lets
-- move-out actually revoke ownership. Readers already tolerate a null
-- owner_id (they fall back to the HomeOwner table, which is the real
-- ownership record).
