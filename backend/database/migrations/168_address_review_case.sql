-- Migration 168: Address review queue
--
-- SCN-11: `manual_review` is emitted as the next action by six rungs of the
-- decision ladder (addressDecisionEngine.js), and no queue, route or admin
-- surface consumed it. Every escalation was a dead end: the engine said "a
-- human should look at this" and no human ever could. That makes every
-- "route to manual review" remedy in the design non-functional, which is why
-- ambiguous addresses were either silently accepted or silently refused
-- (audit 2026-08-22).
--
-- AddressVerificationEvent is append-only telemetry and cannot serve as a work
-- queue: it has no assignment, no state, and no outcome.
