-- Migration 170: take the verification-credential tables away from the
-- `authenticated` role.
--
-- Migration 160 closed the plaintext half of the mail-code bypass (the code was
-- being written into MailVerificationJob.metadata, which the claimant could read
-- back) but revoked only `anon`. Migration 070 still stands:
--
--   GRANT ALL ON TABLE "AddressVerificationToken" TO "authenticated";
--
-- together with policy `addr_verif_token_select_own`, which grants the requester
-- SELECT on their own token row. That row holds `code_hash` — an UNSALTED
-- SHA-256 over a six-digit code. A 900,000-entry rainbow table is built in well
-- under a second, so possession of the hash is possession of the code, and the
-- bypass 160 was written to close survives verbatim on the sibling table.
--
-- Migration 162 introduced the same shape on the legacy path that iOS and
-- Android actually use: it replaced HomePostcardCode's cleartext column with a
-- hash and then re-granted SELECT to `authenticated` under the comment "the hash
-- is never useful to them". For an unsalted SHA-256 of a six-digit code, it is.
--
-- Nothing in the application reads any of these tables as `anon` or
-- `authenticated`: every access goes through supabaseAdmin (the service role),
-- which is exempt from both grants and RLS. Migration 160's own header says as
-- much. The pending-postcard status a user is meant to see is already served
-- server-side by routes/homeIam.js, which selects only expires_at.
--
-- Revoking the grant is the control; the policies are dropped too so nothing
-- reads as though a client path were still intended.
