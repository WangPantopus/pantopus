-- Migration 169: When was this residency actually verified?
--
-- §5.1 / LIF-04 — `HomeOccupancy.verification_status` is one bit and it is the
-- only bit. The system had no column recording WHEN a residency was verified,
-- so it structurally could not express "this verification is 29 months old".
-- Every trust decision treated a verification from three years ago and one from
-- this morning as identical, while roughly a tenth of the population moves each
-- year (audit 2026-08-22).
--
-- This adds the timestamps. It deliberately does NOT change any access
-- decision: enforcement is gated behind the `address.enforce_verification_expiry`
-- runtime flag (migration 167 / utils/addressRolloutFlags.js), shipped disabled.
-- Expiring the existing verified base is a product decision, not a migration.
