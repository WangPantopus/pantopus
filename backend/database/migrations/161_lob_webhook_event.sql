-- Migration 161: Idempotency + replay protection for Lob webhooks
--
-- SECURITY. routes/lobWebhook.js verified the Lob signature only when
-- LOB_WEBHOOK_SECRET happened to be set, and that variable was not in the
-- production-required list, so a production deploy missing it accepted any
-- unauthenticated POST. There was also no replay protection and no event
-- de-duplication, so a captured (or forged) `postcard.returned_to_sender`
-- could be replayed to expire a legitimate user's in-flight verification.
--
-- This table gives the handler the same idempotency guarantee the Stripe
-- webhook already has (see "StripeWebhookEvent").
