-- 163_home_systems_integrity.sql
-- Referential integrity for the Systems Ledger, and a real uniqueness
-- guarantee for provenance capture.
--
-- Two gaps in migration 161 and in the gig-completion hook:
--
-- 1. HomeSystem.home_id was NOT NULL with no REFERENCES, unlike every
--    sibling table (HomeMaintenanceLog cascades on Home delete; migration
--    154 adds four FKs in guarded blocks). Homes really are deleted
--    (routes/home.js), so rows carrying resident-entered years and a user
--    id would have survived the home they describe — an erasure gap, not
--    just untidiness. `updated_by` likewise had no FK.
--
-- 2. `recordCompletedJob` claims "one row per gig" but implements it as a
--    SELECT-then-INSERT with nothing behind it. Two concurrent owner
--    confirms double-insert; the easy path needs no Stripe race at all,
--    because a gig with a null payment_id skips capture entirely and
--    confirmCompletionHelper has no owner_confirmed_at guard. A partial
--    unique index makes the claim true rather than aspirational.
