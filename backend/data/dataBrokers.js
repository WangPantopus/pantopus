/**
 * Unlisted (Wave 4) — the data-broker registry.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: the sites that republish US county property records, and
 * the exact, verified path to remove yourself from each. It is the
 * actionable half of Unlisted — the value was never confirming that
 * you are listed, it is the removal path.
 *
 * WHY WE DO NOT SCAN: the obvious build is querying ~30 people-search
 * sites with the user's address and reporting what comes back. We
 * deliberately do not, for a reason that outranks the others: querying
 * a people-search site with someone's address DISCLOSES that address to
 * that broker. A scan meant to reduce exposure would create it. (It is
 * also legally grey, brittle against blocking, slow enough to kill the
 * conversion it exists to drive, and needs the permanent scraper
 * staffing that is the stated reason the erase tier waits.)
 *
 * THEREFORE THE COPY RULE, enforced by the shape of this file: nothing
 * here asserts that a given person IS listed anywhere. There is no
 * `found` field and there never should be. Every entry describes what a
 * site publishes and how to leave it — both true without querying
 * anyone.
 *
 * EVERY FIELD MUST BE VERIFIED. A wrong opt-out URL is worse than no
 * entry: it sends someone frightened enough to be doing this to a dead
 * end, or to a form that harvests more data than it removes. Each entry
 * carries `source_url` (the page that was actually fetched) and
 * `verified_at`. An entry that cannot be verified is omitted, not
 * guessed — a short accurate list beats a long invented one.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE: brokers move their opt-out pages. `verified_at` is the
 * honesty marker; the UI should say when the list was last checked, and
 * entries should be re-verified on a schedule rather than assumed good
 * forever.
