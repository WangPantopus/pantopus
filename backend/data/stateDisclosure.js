/**
 * Unlisted (Wave 4) — what each state exposes, and its escape hatch.
 *
 * The most valuable thing on the Unlisted page is not the broker list.
 * It is this: most US states run an ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAM —
 * a legal substitute address for survivors of domestic violence, sexual
 * assault, stalking or trafficking, so the real one stays out of public
 * records at the source rather than being chased across thirty sites
 * forever.
 *
 * Someone typing their address into a page called "get my address off
 * the internet" is disproportionately likely to be doing it because of
 * a specific person. For that reader this is the single highest-value
 * fact we can surface, and the broker list is the consolation prize.
 * It is placed first for that reason.
 *
 * ACCURACY IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. A wrong program name or a dead link
 * fails someone at the worst possible moment. Every entry carries the
 * official source it was verified against; an unverifiable entry is
 * omitted rather than guessed, and the UI must degrade to "we could not
 * confirm a program for your state" rather than inventing one.
 *
 * We do NOT ask why someone is here, we do not record that they looked,
 * and the T0 endpoint persists nothing.
