# Calendarly — Android Parallel Work-Stream Specification

> Platform: **Android** (Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Hilt DI, Retrofit/Moshi; base package `app.pantopus.android`).
> App root: `frontend/apps/android`. Screens under `app/src/main/java/app/pantopus/android/ui/screens/`.
> Companion contract: [`reference/calendarly-backend-api.md`](../calendarly-backend-api.md) (backend feature-complete on `feature/calendarly` — migrations 159–165, ~70 endpoints). Screen specs: `~/Downloads/calendarly-design-prompt-suite.md` (= `reference/calendarly-design-prompt-suite.md`).

This document defines **1 Foundation stream (A0)** + **18 feature streams (A1…A18)** that collectively deliver all **92 buildable Android screens** of Calendarly (the canonical 94-screen inventory minus `C9 Embed Widget` = web-only and `D9` reduced to a native interstitial). Foundation (A0) is a **serial gate**: it merges to `master` first. After that, all 18 feature streams run **fully in parallel** and **merge to `master` in any order with zero conflicts**, because every feature stream edits a **disjoint set of files** — the only files touched by more than one stream are owned exclusively by Foundation, and Foundation is already merged before any feature stream branches.

Calendarly is a Calendly/Cal.com-style booking layer over Pantopus with **one owner-polymorphic engine** and three identity pillars: **Personal (sky / `PantopusColors.primary600`)**, **Home (green / `PantopusColors.home`)**, **Business (violet / `PantopusColors.business`)**.

---

## 1. How to use this doc

The operator runs ~19 independent agent sessions:

1. **First, run Foundation (A0).** Hand the agent the entire "Foundation spec (A0)" section. It merges to `master`. **Nothing else starts until A0 is on `master`.**
2. **Then, for each feature stream**, start one fresh agent session and paste:
   - that stream's full section from this doc (it is self-contained), **plus**
   - the **shared RULES preamble** + **GLOBAL WIRING CONTRACT** (§4), **plus**
   - the **design prompts for that stream's screen IDs** (the operator copies them from `reference/calendarly-design-prompt-suite.md` at build time — only the screen designs, not the whole suite).
3. Each agent branches from `master` (which already contains A0), builds **only the files its section lists under "Files this stream OWNS"**, opens **one PR**, and merges to `master`.

An agent must be able to build its entire stream from **its section + the pasted designs + the shared preamble** alone. If an agent finds it needs to edit a shared seam file (a route, a DI provider, a Me tile, a DTO, an endpoint, a shared component), it **STOPS and flags a Foundation gap** — it never edits the seam locally. That rule is what preserves conflict-free parallel merge.

---

## 2. Screen scope on Android (92 of 94)

- **`C9 Embed Widget` — WEB ONLY.** Not built on Android. (An embeddable web widget has no native analog.)
- **`D9 Open-in-App / Deep-Link Hand-off`** — on native this is a **local interstitial** that consumes an inbound `pantopus://…/book/…` deep link and routes into the in-app booking flow. It reuses the existing deep-link handling **read-only** (`core/routing/DeepLinkRouter`, referenced from `RootTabScreen`); it adds no new global route plumbing.
- **`H14 Accessibility & Large-Text pass`** is a **cross-cutting audit folded into A18** (scoped to A18's own files + a checklist applied per stream).

All other 92 screens are built. Each screen appears in **exactly one** stream (coverage table in §7).

---

## 3. Conflict-safety architecture (Android)

### 3.1 The shared seams (the real hazards)

On Android, four file regions are edited by feature work in the *normal* (non-parallel) flow. Left to 18 agents, they would collide on every PR. Foundation **centralizes all four** so feature streams never touch them:

| Seam | File | Why it collides | Foundation mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nav routes + NavHost** | `ui/screens/root/RootTabScreen.kt` (the `private object ChildRoutes` route constants + builder funcs + the `NavHost { composable(route, arguments){…} }` blocks; file is ~4,360 lines) | Every screen adds a `const val` route + a `composable(...)` block | A0 **pre-adds ALL scheduling route constants + ALL `composable(...)` blocks**, each pointing at a **stub screen composable** declared in a feature folder. Feature streams fill the stub body in their **own** files; `RootTabScreen.kt` is never re-edited. |
| **Hilt DI providers** | `di/NetworkModule.kt` | Each new Retrofit `*Api` needs an `@Provides @Singleton` | A0 adds the `@Provides` for **every** scheduling Api (`SchedulingApi`, `SchedulingPublicApi`) once. |
| **"Me" hub tiles + dispatch** | `ui/screens/you/me/MeViewModel.kt` (`MeActionTile`/`MeSectionRow` with `routeKey`) + `ui/screens/you/YouScreen.kt` (the `when (tile.routeKey)` dispatch) | Entry points into scheduling per pillar | A0 adds the Calendarly tiles (e.g. `me.scheduling.hub`) + their dispatch lambdas once. |
| **Networking contract** | `data/api/services/SchedulingApi.kt`, `SchedulingPublicApi.kt`; `data/api/models/scheduling/*Dtos.kt`; `data/scheduling/SchedulingRepository.kt` | Shared DTOs + endpoints used by many streams | A0 owns **the entire contract layer**: both Api interfaces (all ~70 endpoints), all DTOs, the repository, the `SchedulingOwner` helper, and the typed 409/error decoder. |

### 3.2 Why Foundation must go first

A feature stream cannot compile without: (a) the `composable(...)` route block + stub it fills, (b) the `*Api`/DTO/`SchedulingRepository` it calls, (c) the DI provider, (d) the Me tile that reaches it. All four live in A0-owned files. So **A0 merges to `master` first**; every feature stream branches from a `master` that already has them. There is exactly one serial dependency edge in the whole plan: `A0 → {A1…A18}`.

### 3.3 The disjoint-ownership guarantee

After A0 is merged, each feature stream creates files only under **its own scheduling sub-folder** (e.g. `ui/screens/scheduling/hub/**`, `ui/screens/scheduling/eventtypes/**`, …) and never edits a seam file. Two different streams never name the same file. Therefore any two feature-stream PRs touch **disjoint file sets** and **git-merge cleanly in any order**. There is no shared mutable index, manifest, or generated file: Compose Navigation is wired entirely inside the already-merged `RootTabScreen.kt`; Hilt providers already exist; Moshi adapters are generated per-DTO via KSP from A0-owned DTOs.

### 3.4 The two exclusive-owner exceptions

Two streams edit **existing files outside** the scheduling folder. Each is the **sole/exclusive owner** of those files for the duration of the project, so there is still no contention:

- **A10 (Home calendar & RSVP)** is the **EXCLUSIVE owner** of `ui/screens/homes/calendar/**` (`HomeCalendarScreen`/`ViewModel`, `AddEventFormScreen`/`VM`, `EventDetailScreen`/`VM`, `CalendarEventCategory`, `MonthStripHeader`). It *extends* the existing Home Calendar module to render the **booking union** (`source:'booking'`) and RSVP. No other stream edits these files.
- **A14 (Payments & payouts)** is the **EXCLUSIVE owner** of additions under `ui/screens/wallet/**` (Calendarly payments setup, payouts/earnings views) and reuses the existing Stripe Connect plumbing. No other stream edits wallet files.

These two are called out so the orchestrator does not accidentally hand the same existing files to another stream.

### 3.5 Why there are no conflicts on *this* platform specifically

- **Web** avoids conflicts via **file-based routing** (each page is its own file; no shared router) — N/A here.
- **iOS** avoids conflicts because **`project.pbxproj` is converted to a file-system-synchronized root group** so new `.swift` files need no pbxproj edit. **Correction to the iOS implementation-phases doc:** that doc treats `project.pbxproj` as the #1 hazard requiring the synced-group conversion; the working assumption in the iOS workstreams plan is that, with the synced group in place, **pbxproj is effectively not tracked for per-file adds** — Foundation does the one synced-group conversion and thereafter no feature stream edits pbxproj.
- **Android** has **no per-file manifest** (Gradle compiles the whole source tree) — the only shared mutable surfaces are the **NavHost/DI/Me** seams, which Foundation **pre-stubs and centralizes**. After that, adding a screen = adding a new file in your own folder. Hence zero conflicts.

---

## 4. Shared RULES preamble + GLOBAL WIRING CONTRACT

> **Paste this section verbatim into every feature-stream agent session.**

### 4.1 RULES every feature-stream agent MUST follow

1. **Only create/edit files this stream OWNS.** If you think you need to add/edit a shared seam file (contract types/DTOs, endpoints/API service, DI provider, a route/`composable(...)` block in `RootTabScreen.kt`, a Me tile in `MeViewModel.kt`/`YouScreen.kt`, or a Foundation shared component), **STOP and flag it as a Foundation gap** — do not add it locally.
2. **Present this stream's sheets/modals/states LOCALLY** from your own parent screens (Compose `ModalBottomSheet`, dialogs, in-screen state). **Never add a global route/destination.** The stub `composable(...)` for your top-level screens already exists in `RootTabScreen.kt`; you only fill the stub body in your own files.
3. **Reuse the shared shells and Foundation components**; use **design-system theme tokens only** (`ui/theme/Color.kt` `PantopusColors`, `LocalPantopusTokens` from `Theme.kt`). **No hardcoded colors/spacing.** Pillar accents: Personal = `primary600`, Home = `home`, Business = `business`.
4. **Honor the GLOBAL WIRING CONTRACT** (§4.2): owner context, tz, manageToken, 409 alternatives, calendar union, paused/secret/expired states, paid feature flag, 501 connect.
5. **Targeted tests only.** Test only this stream's ViewModels/services. Verify on an emulator with a **hosted-dev account** against the **live endpoint** (migrations 159–165 applied). Never run full suites. Keep test bookings/pages.
6. **One PR per stream to `master`** (never push `master` directly). Build green + verified + screenshots vs design. Branch name: `claude/calendarly-android-<id>-<slug>`.

### 4.2 GLOBAL WIRING CONTRACT (from `reference/calendarly-backend-api.md`)

- **Owner context** (use the Foundation `SchedulingOwner` helper, which injects this):
  - **Personal** → omit owner fields (defaults to signed-in user).
  - **Business** → `owner_type:'business'` + `owner_id:<business_user_id>` (query param on GET, body field on writes).
  - **Home** → call the `/api/homes/:homeId/scheduling/*` alias (no owner fields).
- **Timezone:** ALWAYS pass `tz` (IANA) on slot/calendar reads. **Render `startLocal`, store/compare UTC.**
- **manageToken:** persist the one-time `manageToken` returned by `POST /book/...` (and `POST /book/o/:token`) — it is the invitee's only handle for manage/reschedule/cancel/.ics.
- **409 conflict:** every booking create/reschedule may return `409 { error, alternatives:[{start,end,startLocal}] }` (codes `SLOT_TAKEN | SLOT_UNAVAILABLE | SLOT_FULL`). **Surface nearest open times — never a dead end.** Use the Foundation 409 decoder.
- **Home calendar UNION:** home bookings appear via `GET /api/homes/:id/events` rows tagged `source:'booking'` (+ `booking_status`). **NEVER create `HomeCalendarEvent` rows for bookings.**
- **First-class non-error states:** `paused`, `secret`, `unavailable`, `expired` are response states, not errors (e.g. `status:'paused'`, `status:'expired'`, `status:'unavailable'`).
- **Paid surfaces** (priced event types, packages, invoices, payouts) sit behind the Foundation **feature flag** + **Stripe TEST mode**. Payout settlement is deferred server-side — show **processing/pending**.
- **`POST /connected-calendars/connect` returns 501** → show **"coming soon"**; read endpoints return empty.
- **Error envelope:** `{ error:'CODE', message }`; validation → `400 { error:'Validation failed', details:[{field,message}] }`. Use the Foundation typed decoder.
- **Public booking fetch** hits the backend origin directly: `/api/public/book/:slug` (slug = the **booking PAGE slug**, not a booking id). One-off links: `/api/public/book/o/:token`. Manage: `/api/public/booking/:token*`.

---

## 5. Foundation spec (A0) — the serial gate

**Branch & PR:** `claude/calendarly-android-A0-foundation` → one PR → merge to `master` **before any feature stream branches**.

**Goal:** Build the entire shared scaffold so the 18 feature streams compile and run against disjoint files: the full networking contract (both Api interfaces, all DTOs, repository, owner helper, error/409 decoder), the DI providers, the centralized NavHost routes + pre-stubbed screen composables, the Me hub tiles + dispatch, the feature flag, and the shared scheduling-specific components. **A0 builds NO finished feature screen** — only stubs + shared infrastructure.

It is fine to split A0 into two PRs if useful (**A0a = contract + DI + flag + shared components**, **A0b = NavHost route stubs + Me tiles + dispatch**), as long as both land on `master` before feature streams start.

### 5.1 Files A0 OWNS (creates/edits)

**Contract layer (creates):**
- `data/api/services/SchedulingApi.kt` — Retrofit interface for the **host** mount. Covers `/api/scheduling/*` and the `/api/homes/{homeId}/scheduling/*` alias: booking-page CRUD + slug + check-slug + reset-slug + disable; event-types CRUD + `:id` + assignees + questions; availability schedules/rules/overrides/blocks; notification-preferences; one-off-links; workflows; message-templates (+ preview); payments/status; connected-calendars (read + connect-501); bookings (list, summary, `:id`, available-slots, create, approve/decline/cancel/reschedule/no-show/reassign/rsvp, recurring, nudge, propose-reschedule, apply-credit, insights/no-shows, insights/team); invoices (list/`:id`/send); packages (CRUD + buy); my-packages; my-bookings; find-a-time; whos-free; resources (CRUD + book); visits; waitlist (list + promote); polls (create/list/`:id`/finalize); team-availability. Each method carries a doc-comment with the backend route + the API-doc line.
- `data/api/services/SchedulingPublicApi.kt` — Retrofit interface for the **public** mount (`/api/public/*`, **backend origin, no auth**): `GET /book/{slug}`, `GET /book/{slug}/{eventTypeSlug}/slots`, `POST /book/{slug}/{eventTypeSlug}`, `POST /book/{slug}/{eventTypeSlug}/waitlist`, `GET /book/o/{token}`, `POST /book/o/{token}`, `GET /booking/{token}`, `GET /booking/{token}/available-slots`, `GET /booking/{token}/ics`, `POST /booking/{token}/reschedule`, `POST /booking/{token}/cancel`, `POST /booking/{token}/unsubscribe`, `POST /booking/{token}/accept-reschedule`, `POST /booking/{token}/decline-reschedule`, `GET /poll/{id}`, `POST /poll/{id}/vote`.
- `data/api/models/scheduling/*Dtos.kt` — all DTOs, `@JsonClass(generateAdapter=true)` + `@Json(name="snake_case")`. Suggested files: `BookingPageDtos.kt`, `EventTypeDtos.kt`, `AvailabilityDtos.kt`, `SlotDtos.kt` (Slot `{start,end,startLocal,eligibleHosts}`), `BookingDtos.kt`, `PublicBookingDtos.kt` (page view, event-type view, manage view + `actions`/`payment`), `WorkflowDtos.kt`, `MessageTemplateDtos.kt`, `PackageDtos.kt`, `InvoiceDtos.kt`, `ResourceDtos.kt`, `VisitDtos.kt`, `PollDtos.kt`, `WaitlistDtos.kt`, `InsightsDtos.kt`, `NotificationPrefsDtos.kt`, `SchedulingErrorDtos.kt` (`{error,message}`, `{error:'Validation failed',details:[{field,message,code}]}`, `409 {error,alternatives:[{start,end,startLocal}]}`).
- `data/scheduling/SchedulingRepository.kt` — wraps both Apis in `safeApiCall` → `NetworkResult<T>` (pattern: `data/api/net/NetworkResult.kt`, `safeApiCall`). One repository (or a host/public split) exposing suspend funs for every endpoint. **All streams call this repository, never the Api directly.**
- `data/scheduling/SchedulingOwner.kt` — the owner-context helper. A sealed type `SchedulingOwner { Personal; Business(businessUserId); Home(homeId) }` with helpers that (a) produce GET query params (`owner_type`/`owner_id` for Business; nothing for Personal), (b) produce write-body owner fields, and (c) pick the host base path vs the `/api/homes/{homeId}/scheduling` alias for Home. Repository methods accept a `SchedulingOwner`.
- `data/scheduling/SchedulingError.kt` — typed decoder mapping the error envelope to a sealed type: `Validation(details)`, `Conflict(code, alternatives)` (the 409 `SLOT_TAKEN|SLOT_UNAVAILABLE|SLOT_FULL` decode), `Paused`, `Expired`, `Unavailable`, `SlugTaken(suggestions)`, `NotAvailable501`, `Generic(code,message)`. Extends/uses `NetworkError` from `data/api/net/`.
- `data/scheduling/SchedulingFeatureFlags.kt` — the **paid feature flag** (e.g. `paidSchedulingEnabled`), driven from `BuildConfig` / remote-config; default OFF in prod, ON for hosted-dev. Foundation also exposes Stripe **test-mode** wiring reuse.

**DI (edits):**
- `di/NetworkModule.kt` — add `@Provides @Singleton fun provideSchedulingApi(retrofit): SchedulingApi` and `provideSchedulingPublicApi(...)`. The public Api must target the **backend origin base URL** (not the authed app base) — if a second Retrofit/base-url is needed, provide it here with a qualifier.

**Routing seam (edits):**
- `ui/screens/root/RootTabScreen.kt` — in `private object ChildRoutes`, add **all** scheduling route `const val`s (e.g. `SCHEDULING_HUB`, `SCHEDULING_SETTINGS`, `EVENT_TYPE_LIST`, `EVENT_TYPE_EDITOR = "scheduling/event-types/{eventTypeId}"`, `AVAILABILITY_LIST`, `BOOKING_PAGE_MANAGE`, `PUBLIC_BOOKING = "book/{slug}"`, `MANAGE_BOOKING = "booking/{manageToken}"`, `BOOKINGS_INBOX`, `BOOKING_DETAIL`, `FIND_A_TIME`, `BUSINESS_SCHEDULING_SETTINGS`, `PAYMENTS_SETUP`, `PAYOUTS`, `PACKAGES_LIST`, `INVOICES_LIST`, `REMINDERS_QUICK_SETUP`, `WORKFLOWS_LIST`, `INSIGHTS_DASHBOARD`, etc. — one top-level route per top-level screen across all 18 streams, with `{arg}` placeholders). Add the matching `NavHost { composable(route, arguments=listOf(navArgument(...))) { … } }` blocks, each calling a **stub screen composable** that lives in the **feature stream's folder** (e.g. `composable(ChildRoutes.SCHEDULING_HUB){ SchedulingHubScreen(...) }`). Stubs are declared by feature streams; A0 declares thin placeholder stubs only if needed to compile, and feature streams replace the placeholder body in their own files. **A0 is the last edit to `RootTabScreen.kt`.**

**Me seam (edits):**
- `ui/screens/you/me/MeViewModel.kt` — add `MeActionTile`/`MeSectionRow` entries with routeKeys (e.g. `me.scheduling.hub` for Personal; `me.business.scheduling` for Business; `me.home.scheduling` / reuse the existing `me.calendar` for Home).
- `ui/screens/you/YouScreen.kt` — add the `when (tile.routeKey)` dispatch arms calling new `onOpenScheduling*` lambdas, and thread those lambdas down from `RootTabScreen`.
- (Read-only reference: `ui/screens/you/me/MeIdentity.kt` for pillar colors.)

**Shared scheduling components A0 must build (creates, under `ui/screens/scheduling/_shared/`):**
- `OwnerPillarChrome.kt` — applies the Personal/Home/Business accent to a screen header (wraps `PantopusColors` + `WizardIdentity` mapping).
- `SlotPicker.kt` — reusable date+time slot grid that takes `List<SlotDto>`, renders `startLocal`, exposes selection; used by C6, E4, F5, etc.
- `TimezonePicker.kt` — IANA tz selector (C7).
- `ConflictAlternativesSheet.kt` — a local `ModalBottomSheet` that renders 409 `alternatives` (nearest open times) and re-emits a chosen slot. Used by every create/reschedule surface (do not duplicate per stream).
- `PausedExpiredUnavailableState.kt` — the first-class non-error state surface (paused / expired / unavailable / secret).
- `SchedulingStateScaffolding.kt` — shared loading/empty/error scaffolding aligned to `ListOfRowsUiState` so streams reuse one state idiom.
- `ManageTokenStore.kt` — persistence for the one-time `manageToken` (e.g. DataStore-backed), keyed by booking id.
- `MoneyAndFlag.kt` — price formatting (`price_cents`/`currency`) + the `SchedulingFeatureFlags` gate composable for paid surfaces.

**Tests (creates):** `app/src/test/.../scheduling/SchedulingOwnerTest.kt`, `SchedulingErrorDecoderTest.kt` (409 alternatives + validation + paused/expired decode), `SchedulingRepositoryTest.kt` (owner-context param injection per pillar).

### 5.2 Files A0 MUST produce so feature streams have stubs

For **every top-level screen route** added to `ChildRoutes`, A0 ensures a `composable(...)` block exists that calls a screen composable **by name** in the owning stream's folder. A0 may declare a minimal placeholder body; the feature stream replaces that file's body. The route + composable wiring is **never re-touched** by feature streams.

### 5.3 Acceptance (A0)

- Builds green: `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt test :app:assembleDebug` (run `ktlintFormat --rerun-tasks` first per repo CI quirk; detekt baseline at `app/detekt-baseline.xml`).
- New unit tests pass: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "app.pantopus.android.*.scheduling.*"`.
- App launches on emulator with a hosted-dev account; every scheduling route resolves to its stub without crash; Me tiles navigate to the stubs.
- `SchedulingRepository` verified against the live endpoint for at least one read per pillar (Personal `GET /booking-page`, Home alias `GET /api/homes/:id/scheduling/...`, Business with `owner_type=business`).
- **Merge to `master` first.**

## 6. The 18 feature streams

> **Common to all streams below.** Track = which pillar(s) the stream primarily serves. "Files this stream MUST NOT touch" always includes the A0 seam files: `RootTabScreen.kt`, `di/NetworkModule.kt`, `ui/screens/you/me/MeViewModel.kt`, `ui/screens/you/YouScreen.kt`, `data/api/services/SchedulingApi.kt`, `data/api/services/SchedulingPublicApi.kt`, `data/api/models/scheduling/**`, `data/scheduling/**`, `ui/screens/scheduling/_shared/**` — plus every other stream's folder. **Reuses (read-only)** always include: A0's `SchedulingRepository`, `SchedulingOwner`, `SchedulingError`, the `_shared/` components, and the shells `ui/screens/shared/{list_of_rows,form,wizard,content_detail}/`. ViewModels are `@HiltViewModel` with `StateFlow<XUiState>` sealed states; read nav args via `SavedStateHandle`. **Acceptance, common to all:** `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt :app:assembleDebug` green; targeted tests `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "app.pantopus.android.ui.screens.scheduling.<folder>.*"`; Paparazzi snapshots for new screens (`./gradlew :app:paparazziVerify` / record); verify on emulator with a hosted-dev account against the live endpoint; screenshots vs the pasted designs. **Depends on:** Android Foundation (A0) only. **Branch:** `claude/calendarly-android-<id>-<slug>`, one PR, merges to `master` conflict-free.

**Reuses (read-only):** `WizardShell`/`WizardIdentity`, `FormShell`, `OwnerPillarChrome`, `SchedulingStateScaffolding`, repository slug/page/summary/prefs calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; empty/zero-state (no page yet → wizard CTA); slug **available/taken** with suggestions (live `check-slug`); reset-slug **danger-zone confirm** (invalidates old link); pillar accenting per `SchedulingOwner`; tz selection persisted on the page; error envelope decode. No 409/manageToken here.
**Acceptance checks:** common acceptance; verify slug check + page create on live dev; targeted tests for `SchedulingHubViewModel`/`FirstRunWizardViewModel`/`NotificationPrefsViewModel`.

---

### Stream A2 — Event Types   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP+v2]  (~4 screens)
**Goal:** Create and configure bookable event types/services, intake questions, and the (501) connected-calendars surface.
**Screens (this stream owns):** B1 Event Type/Service List [MVP]; B2 Event Type/Service Editor [MVP]; B3 Intake Questions Editor [v2]; B8 Connected Calendars [v2 → 501].
**Backend endpoints used:** `GET /event-types`, `POST /event-types`, `GET /event-types/:id` (returns assignees + questions), `PUT /event-types/:id`, `DELETE /event-types/:id` (409 `HAS_UPCOMING_BOOKINGS` → deactivate-instead path), `PUT /event-types/:id/questions` (B3, replace-all), `GET /connected-calendars` (read; empty), `POST /connected-calendars/connect` (**501 → "coming soon"**). Owner context via `SchedulingOwner`. Note `default_duration` must be in `durations`; `visibility:'public'|'secret'`; `price_cents`/`currency` gated by the paid flag in the editor.
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/eventtypes/**` (`EventTypeListScreen.kt`/`VM`, `EventTypeEditorScreen.kt`/`VM`, `IntakeQuestionsEditorScreen.kt`/`VM`, `ConnectedCalendarsScreen.kt`/`VM`). Fills A0 stubs `EVENT_TYPE_LIST`, `EVENT_TYPE_EDITOR`, `INTAKE_QUESTIONS_EDITOR`, `CONNECTED_CALENDARS`.

**Reuses (read-only):** `FormShell`, `ListOfRowsScreen`/`ListOfRowsUiState`, `OwnerPillarChrome`, `MoneyAndFlag` (price + paid-flag gate), repository event-type calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; empty (no event types → create CTA); editor validation (duration range, slug `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,60}$`, `default_duration ∈ durations`); `SLUG_TAKEN` 409 inline; `DELETE` 409 → suggest deactivate; **secret** visibility flag; **501** connect → coming-soon; paid fields hidden when flag off.
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify CRUD + 501 connect on live dev; targeted tests for `EventTypeListViewModel`/`EventTypeEditorViewModel`.

---

### Stream A3 — Availability   [Personal] [MVP+v2]  (~5 screens)
**Goal:** Manage availability schedules, weekly hours, date overrides/holidays, booking limits/notice rules, and ad-hoc block-off time.
**Screens (this stream owns):** B4 Availability Schedule List [MVP]; B5 Weekly Hours Editor [MVP]; B6 Date Overrides & Holidays [v2]; B7 Booking Limits & Notice Rules [v2]; B9 Block off time [MVP].

### Stream A4 — Booking page & sharing   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP+v2]  (~5 screens)
**Goal:** Manage the public booking page, preview it, share the link, generate one-off/single-use links, and present link/page empty + zero states. **(No C9 Embed Widget — web only.)**
**Screens (this stream owns):** C1 Booking Link/Public Page Management [MVP]; C2 Public Booking Page Preview [MVP]; C3 Share Your Link Sheet [MVP]; C4 One-off/Single-use Link Generator [MVP]; H16 Booking-Link/Page Empty & Zero-State [MVP].
**Backend endpoints used:** `GET /booking-page`, `PUT /booking-page` (is_live/is_paused/visibility/branding), `POST /booking-page/disable`, `PUT /booking-page/slug` + `GET /booking-page/check-slug` (shared concern with A1 — A4 reads page state, A1 owns the wizard), `POST /booking-page/one-off-links` (C4; returns `{token, path, expires_at, single_use}` — **token returned once**, store in the share href), and for **C2 preview** the public `GET /api/public/book/:slug` (render the live page exactly as invitees see it, honoring `status:'paused'`).
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/bookingpage/**` (`BookingPageManageScreen.kt`/`VM`, `PublicPagePreviewScreen.kt`/`VM`, `ShareLinkSheet.kt` (local `ModalBottomSheet`), `OneOffLinkGeneratorScreen.kt`/`VM`, `BookingPageZeroState.kt`). Fills A0 stubs `BOOKING_PAGE_MANAGE`, `PUBLIC_PAGE_PREVIEW`, `ONE_OFF_LINK_GENERATOR`.
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders. (A1 owns the first-run wizard; A5/A6 own the invitee-side public render — A4's C2 preview is the **host's** preview of their own page.)
**Reuses (read-only):** `content_detail` shell for preview, `OwnerPillarChrome`, share via existing `shareText`/`InviteLinks` helpers (read-only), `PausedExpiredUnavailableState`, repository page + one-off calls + `SchedulingPublicApi` read.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; **zero-state** (H16: no page / no event types yet → setup CTA); `is_paused`/`is_live` toggles; **paused** preview state; share sheet (copy/share intent); one-off link **expiry + single-use** config; **token-shown-once** persistence; disable (danger).
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify one-off link create + public preview render on live dev; targeted tests for `BookingPageManageViewModel`/`OneOffLinkGeneratorViewModel`.

### Stream A5 — Invitee discovery   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP]  (~4 screens)
**Goal:** The public invitee-facing discovery flow: booker landing/profile, date+time slot picker, timezone selector, and the no-availability state. **(Public, unauthenticated — hits the backend origin.)**
**Screens (this stream owns):** C5 Booking Landing/Booker Profile [MVP]; C6 Date+Time Slot Picker [MVP]; C7 Timezone Selector [MVP]; C8 Slot/No-Availability State [MVP].
**Backend endpoints used (public):** `GET /api/public/book/:slug` (page + event-type list; `status:'active'|'paused'`, 404 `status:'unavailable'`), `GET /api/public/book/:slug/:eventTypeSlug/slots?from&to&tz` (slots with `startLocal`; paused → empty + `status:'paused'`), and for one-off entry `GET /api/public/book/o/:token` (404 `status:'expired'`). **Always pass `tz`.** This stream stops at slot selection; A6 owns confirm/checkout.
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/invitee/discovery/**` (`BookerLandingScreen.kt`/`VM`, `SlotPickerScreen.kt`/`VM`, `TimezoneSelectorSheet.kt`, `NoAvailabilityState.kt`). Fills A0 stubs `PUBLIC_BOOKING` (`book/{slug}`) and the one-off entry `PUBLIC_BOOKING_ONEOFF` (`book/o/{token}`).
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders.
**Reuses (read-only):** `SlotPicker`, `TimezonePicker`, `PausedExpiredUnavailableState`, `content_detail` shell, `SchedulingPublicApi` reads via repository.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; **paused** page; **expired** one-off; **unavailable** (404); **no-availability** (C8 — empty slots in range → next-available CTA, advance date window); tz selection drives re-fetch; render `startLocal`, store UTC start. No writes here.
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify public page + slots fetch (no auth) on live dev with a real dev page slug; targeted tests for `SlotPickerViewModel`/`BookerLandingViewModel`.

### Stream A6 — Invitee confirm & manage   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP]  (~4 screens)
**Goal:** The invitee booking commit + post-book flow: intake form, review/confirm/checkout, confirmed/thank-you, and manage-your-booking. **Owns the booking POST and the manageToken handoff.**
**Screens (this stream owns):** D1 Intake/Booking Details Form [MVP]; D2 Review & Confirm/Checkout [MVP]; D3 Booking Confirmed/Thank-You [MVP]; D4 Manage Your Booking [MVP].
**Backend endpoints used (public):** `POST /api/public/book/:slug/:eventTypeSlug` (and `POST /api/public/book/o/:token`) → returns `{booking, manageToken, clientSecret?}` (**persist manageToken**, handle `clientSecret` for priced under the paid flag); `GET /api/public/booking/:token` (D4 manage view + `actions`/`payment`); `GET /api/public/booking/:token/ics` (link to A7's Add-to-Calendar). **409** `SLOT_TAKEN|SLOT_UNAVAILABLE|SLOT_FULL` with `alternatives` on the POST → surface via `ConflictAlternativesSheet`. `409 PAGE_PAUSED` and one-off `LINK_USED`/`SLOT_NOT_OFFERED` handled.
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/invitee/confirm/**` (`IntakeFormScreen.kt`/`VM`, `ReviewConfirmScreen.kt`/`VM`, `ConfirmedScreen.kt`/`VM`, `ManageBookingScreen.kt`/`VM`). Fills A0 stub `MANAGE_BOOKING` (`booking/{manageToken}`); the intake/review steps are local steps reached from A5's slot selection (pass slot + slug via nav args/`SavedStateHandle`).
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders. (A7 owns edge/cancel/add-to-cal screens; A6 deep-links to D7/D8/D10 by route.)
**Reuses (read-only):** `FormShell`, `ConflictAlternativesSheet`, `ManageTokenStore`, `MoneyAndFlag` (paid checkout gate), `SchedulingPublicApi` writes via repository.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading/submitting; intake answers (typed per event-type questions); **409 alternatives** → re-pick; **manageToken persisted** (`ManageTokenStore`) keyed to booking; `requires_approval` → pending confirmation copy; priced → Stripe **test-mode** clientSecret behind flag; D4 actions gated by `can_cancel`/`can_reschedule`/deadlines.
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify free booking POST + manage fetch on live dev (keep the test booking); force a 409 (double-book a slot) and confirm alternatives surface; targeted tests for `ReviewConfirmViewModel`/`ManageBookingViewModel` incl. 409 decode.

### Stream A7 — Invitee edge & customer   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP+v2]  (~8 screens)
**Goal:** All invitee/customer edge states + the customer's own surfaces: slot-taken/conflict, payment retry, unavailable/expired/paused/secret, add-to-calendar, open-in-app interstitial, reschedule/cancel cutoff policy, my-bookings, and recurring/multi-session setup.

**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/invitee/edge/**` (`SlotTakenScreen.kt`, `PaymentRetryScreen.kt`/`VM`, `UnavailableExpiredScreen.kt`, `AddToCalendarSheet.kt`, `OpenInAppInterstitialScreen.kt`, `RescheduleCancelPolicyScreen.kt`/`VM`), `ui/screens/scheduling/invitee/customer/**` (`MyBookingsScreen.kt`/`VM`, `RecurringSetupScreen.kt`/`VM`). Fills A0 stubs `MY_BOOKINGS`, `OPEN_IN_APP_INTERSTITIAL`, `RECURRING_SETUP`.
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders; **D9 references `core/routing/DeepLinkRouter` READ-ONLY** (consume the inbound deep link via the already-wired `RootTabScreen` handoff — add no new global route plumbing).
**Reuses (read-only):** `ConflictAlternativesSheet`/decoder, `PausedExpiredUnavailableState`, `ManageTokenStore`, `MoneyAndFlag`, repository public + my-bookings calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** full-screen 409 conflict; payment retry (test mode, paid flag); all four first-class non-error states + secret; ICS add-to-calendar; **deep-link interstitial → in-app booking** (read-only deep-link reuse); policy-blocked cutoff messaging; my-bookings list states; recurring session-array setup.
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify ICS fetch + my-bookings + a policy-blocked cancel on live dev; verify the `pantopus://…/book/…` deep link opens the interstitial on the emulator (`adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "pantopus://…"`); targeted tests for `MyBookingsViewModel`/`RescheduleCancelPolicyViewModel`.

Fills A0 stubs `BOOKINGS_INBOX`, `BOOKING_DETAIL`. (Sheets are local `ModalBottomSheet`s off the detail screen.)
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders. (A9 owns bookings *extras* — share the folder boundary: A9 uses `ui/screens/scheduling/bookings_extra/**`, not `bookings/`.)
**Reuses (read-only):** `ListOfRowsScreen`, `content_detail` shell, `SlotPicker`, `ConflictAlternativesSheet`, `OwnerPillarChrome`, `MoneyAndFlag` (refund amounts), repository bookings calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; empty inbox per status filter (upcoming/pending/past/cancelled); 409 conflict on reschedule → alternatives; reassign validates assignee membership (`INVALID_HOST`); cancel refund estimate + `PAST_DEADLINE`; optimistic status flip with refetch-on-error.

Fills A0 stubs `HOUSEHOLD_AVAILABILITY`, `PERMISSION_GATED_SCHEDULER`; the existing `HOME_CALENDAR`/`ADD_CALENDAR_EVENT`/`CALENDAR_EVENT_DETAIL` routes already exist in `RootTabScreen.kt` and are **left as-is** (A10 edits only the screen files they point to).
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders. **No other stream may edit `ui/screens/homes/calendar/**`.**
**Reuses (read-only):** existing calendar components, `content_detail` shell, `OwnerPillarChrome` (Home green), `PausedExpiredUnavailableState`, repository home-events + availability calls.

**Backend endpoints used:** `PUT /booking-page` `reminder_minutes[]` (H1 quick reminders), `GET /workflows` / `POST /workflows` / `PUT /workflows/:id` / `DELETE /workflows/:id` (H2/H3/H4; trigger `booking_created|cancelled|rescheduled|before_start|after_end`, action `email|push|in_app|sms`, `offset_minutes`), `GET /message-templates` / `POST /message-templates` / `PUT /message-templates/:id` / `DELETE /message-templates/:id` (H5/H8), `POST /message-templates/preview` (H7 — interpolate `{{variables}}`). H6 variable picker is client-side over the known template variable set. Owner context via `SchedulingOwner`.
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/automations/**` (`RemindersQuickSetupScreen.kt`/`VM`, `WorkflowsListScreen.kt`/`VM`, `WorkflowEditorScreen.kt`/`VM`, `TriggerPickerSheet.kt`, `MessageTemplateEditorScreen.kt`/`VM`, `VariablePickerSheet.kt`, `MessagePreviewScreen.kt`/`VM`, `TemplateLibraryScreen.kt`/`VM`). Fills A0 stubs `REMINDERS_QUICK_SETUP`, `WORKFLOWS_LIST`, `WORKFLOW_EDITOR`, `MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_EDITOR`, `TEMPLATE_LIBRARY`.
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders.
**Reuses (read-only):** `ListOfRowsScreen`, `FormShell`, `content_detail` shell, repository workflow/template calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** empty workflows/templates; reminder minutes presets; trigger + offset config; template `{{variable}}` insert + live preview; subject required for email channel; delete confirm; per-event-type vs all (`event_type_id` null).
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify workflow create + template preview on live dev; targeted tests for `WorkflowEditorViewModel`/`MessageTemplateEditorViewModel`.

### Stream A17 — Insights & reports   [Business/Personal] [v2]  (~5 screens)
**Goal:** Analytics: insights dashboard, per-event-type performance, no-show & cancellation report, team performance, and the period/filter sheet.
**Screens (this stream owns):** H9 Insights Dashboard [v2]; H10 Per-Event-Type Performance [v2]; H11 No-Show & Cancellation Report [v2]; H12 Team Performance [v2]; H13 Insights Period & Filter Sheet [v2].
**Backend endpoints used:** `GET /bookings/summary` (H9 headline metrics), `GET /bookings/insights/no-shows?days` (H11; `byEventType`/`byHost`/`recent`), `GET /bookings/insights/team?days` (H12; business-only, `BUSINESS_ONLY`), `GET /bookings?status&event_type_id&from&to` (H10 per-event-type aggregation + H13 filtering). Owner context via `SchedulingOwner`.
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/insights/**` (`InsightsDashboardScreen.kt`/`VM`, `EventTypePerformanceScreen.kt`/`VM`, `NoShowReportScreen.kt`/`VM`, `TeamPerformanceScreen.kt`/`VM`, `InsightsFilterSheet.kt`). Fills A0 stubs `INSIGHTS_DASHBOARD`, `EVENT_TYPE_PERFORMANCE`, `NO_SHOW_REPORT`, `TEAM_PERFORMANCE`.
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + other folders.
**Reuses (read-only):** `content_detail` shell, `ListOfRowsScreen`, `filter_sheet` shell (read-only), `OwnerPillarChrome`, repository insights/summary calls.
**Required states/behaviors:** loading; empty (no data in period); period/days filter (`days` ≤365); team report **business-only gate** (`BUSINESS_ONLY` → not-applicable); no charting library beyond existing tokens (simple bars/rows).
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify summary + no-show report on a dev owner with bookings; targeted tests for `InsightsDashboardViewModel`/`NoShowReportViewModel`.

### Stream A18 — Cross-cutting & polish   [Personal/Home/Business] [MVP+v2]  (~2 screens + a11y cross-cut)
**Goal:** The notification/reminder permission & channel-connect prompt, and the **accessibility & large-text pass (H14)** scoped to A18's own files + a checklist for other streams. **Schedule LAST** (or scope strictly to own files) so it never collides.
**Screens (this stream owns):** H15 Notification/Reminder Permission & Channel Connect Prompt [v2]; H14 Accessibility & Large-Text pass [MVP, cross-cutting].
**Backend endpoints used:** `GET /notification-preferences` + `PUT /notification-preferences` (H15 channel prefs), reuse `POST /connected-calendars/connect` 501 messaging for the "connect" prompt where relevant, and native notification-permission request (Android 13+ `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`). H14 is non-API (audit + checklist).
**Files this stream OWNS:** `ui/screens/scheduling/polish/**` (`NotificationPermissionPromptScreen.kt`/`VM`, `A11yChecklist.kt` — a shared doc/component capturing the large-text/contrast/touch-target audit). Fills A0 stub `NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION_PROMPT`. **H14 audit:** A18 may file Foundation-gap notes for any a11y fix needed in `_shared/` components, but otherwise applies the a11y pass **only to its own files**; the H14 *checklist* is handed to every other stream to apply in-place (each stream applies it to its own files — no cross-folder edits by A18).
**Files this stream MUST NOT touch:** A0 seams + **all other stream folders** (the a11y pass on other streams' files is done *by those streams*, not by A18). A18 edits only `polish/` + flags gaps.
**Reuses (read-only):** `FormShell`, `content_detail` shell, `LocalPantopusTokens` (dynamic type), repository prefs call, existing notification-permission helpers (read-only).
**Required states/behaviors:** permission granted/denied/blocked; channel connect (501 coming-soon where applicable); large-text reflow; min 48dp touch targets; contrast against pillar accents; TalkBack content descriptions.
**Acceptance checks:** common; verify notification-permission prompt + prefs save on emulator; run Compose accessibility checks / large-font (`adb shell settings put system font_scale 1.3`) on A18 screens; targeted tests for `NotificationPermissionPromptViewModel`. Because A18 only edits `polish/`, it merges last with zero contention.

   A18 Cross-cutting & a11y
```

- **Every feature stream depends on A0 only.** The "waves" are a *recommended scheduling order by value/risk*, **not** hard dependencies — all 18 can technically run the moment A0 is on `master`, and all 18 merge to `master` in any order without conflict because their file sets are disjoint.
- **Recommended order:** (1) A0 → merge. (2) MVP backbone: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A8, A10, A13, A14. (3) v2 depth: A7, A9, A11, A12, A15, A16, A17. (4) A18 last.
- **Exclusive-owner streams** (A10 home calendar, A14 wallet) have no extra ordering constraint — they are simply the only editors of their existing files.
- **Inter-stream links are by route, not by code:** e.g. A10's `source:'booking'` row → A8's `BOOKING_DETAIL` route; A5's slot → A6's intake step; A6's manage → A7's add-to-calendar/policy screens. Because every top-level route already exists in the A0-merged `RootTabScreen.kt`, these cross-links compile without any stream editing another's files.
